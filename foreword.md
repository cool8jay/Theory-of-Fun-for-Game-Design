The title of this book almost feels wrong to me. As a game designer, seeing the words "theory" and "fun" in such close proximity instinctively makes me a bit uncomfortable. Theories are dry and academic things, found in thick books at the back of the library, whereas fun is light, energetic, playful and...well...fun.

这本书的书名几乎让我觉得不妥。作为一名游戏设计师，看到“理论”和“乐趣”这两个词如此接近，我本能地感到有些不舒服。理论是枯燥的、学术性的东西，存在于图书馆后面厚厚的书籍中，而乐趣则是轻松的、充满活力的、俏皮的和……嗯……有趣的。

For the first few decades of interactive game design, we were able to blithely ignore many of the larger meta-questions surrounding our craft while we slowly, painfully learned to walk. Now for the first time we are starting to see serious interest in what we do from the academic side. This is forcing those of us in the games industry to stop and consider,

在互动游戏设计的最初几十年里，我们可以轻率地忽略围绕我们这门手艺的许多大的元问题，同时慢慢地、痛苦地学会走路。现在，我们第一次开始看到学术界对我们的工作产生了浓厚的兴趣。这迫使我们这些游戏行业的从业者停下来思考，

"What is this new medium that we're working in?"

"我们所从事的新媒介是什么？"

The academic interest seems twofold: First is the recognition that video games probably represent an emerging new medium, a new design field, and possibly a new art form. All of these are worthy of study. Second, there are an increasing number of motivated students that grew up playing these games and now find themselves inspired to work in the field one day. They want to find schools that will help them understand what games are and how to make them.

学术界的兴趣似乎有两个方面：首先，人们认识到电子游戏可能是一种新兴的媒介、一个新的设计领域，也可能是一种新的艺术形式。所有这些都值得研究。其次，有越来越多的学生在玩这些游戏的过程中成长起来，现在他们发现自己有朝一日会从事这一领域的工作。他们希望找到能帮助他们了解游戏是什么以及如何制作游戏的学校。

One slight problem: there are very few teachers that understand games well enough to teach them, no matter how motivated their students happen to be. Actually it's worse than that, because there are very few people working in the games industry today (and Raph Koster is definitely one of them) who understand games well enough to even communicate what they know and how they know it.

但有一个小问题：无论学生有多积极，能很好地理解游戏并教授游戏的老师都很少。事实上，情况比这更糟糕，因为当今在游戏行业工作的人员（拉斐尔·科斯特无疑是其中之一）中，只有极少数人对游戏有足够的了解，甚至能够将他们所知道的和他们是如何知道的传达给别人。

The bridges between the game industry and the academics that want to study and teach games are slowly beginning to form. A shared language is developing, allowing both sides to speak about games and helping developers to more easily share their experiences with one another. It is in this language that the students of tomorrow will be taught.

游戏产业与希望研究和教授游戏的学术界之间的桥梁正在慢慢形成。一种共同的语言正在形成，使双方都能谈论游戏，并帮助开发人员更容易地相互交流经验。我们将用这种语言来教育未来的学生。
