The holy grail of game system design is to make a game where the challenges are never ending, the skills required are varied, and the difficulty curve is perfect and adjusts itself to exactly our skill level. Someone did this already, though, and it's not always fun. It's called "life." Maybe you've played it.

游戏系统设计的圣杯是制作一款挑战永无止境、所需技能多种多样、难度曲线完美且能根据我们的技能水平自动调整的游戏。不过已经有人做到了，但并不总是有趣的。这就是“生活”。也许你已经玩过了。

Designers often feel proudest of designing good abstract systems that have deep self-generating challenges—games like chess, [go](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], and Othello, and so on. Designing rule sets and making all the content is hard! That hasn't stopped us from trying all sorts of tactics to make games self-refreshing:

设计者通常最引以为豪的是设计出优秀的抽象系统，这些系统具有深刻的自我挑战性——比如国际象棋、[围棋](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]、和黑白棋等等。设计规则集和制作所有内容都很难！但这并不妨碍我们尝试各种策略，让游戏自我刷新：

* **"[Emergent behavior](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]"** is a common buzzword. The goal is new patterns that emerge spontaneously out of the rules, allowing the player to do things that the designer did not foresee. (Players do things designers don't expect all the time, but we don't like to talk about it.) Emergence has proven a tough nut to crack in game design; it usually makes games easier, often by generating loopholes and exploits.\
	**“[涌现行为](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]”** 是一个常用的流行语。目标是从规则中自发产生新的模式，允许玩家做出设计者没有预料到的事情。(玩家经常会做出设计者意想不到的事情，但我们不喜欢谈论它）。事实证明，在游戏设计中，“涌现”是一个难以破解的难题；它通常会让游戏变得更简单，往往是通过产生漏洞和钻空子的方式。

* **We also hear a lot about storytelling.** It's easier to construct a story with multiple possible interpretations than it is to construct a game with the same characteristics. However, most games melded with stories tend to be Frankenstein monsters. Players tend to either skip the story or skip the game. Balancing the two so that they reinforce each other is hard, and often either the story or the game ends up too shallow for repeated play.\
	**我们还经常听到讲故事的说法。** 构建一个有多种可能诠释的故事比构建一个具有相同特点的游戏要容易得多。然而，大多数与故事相融合的游戏往往是科学怪人。玩家往往要么跳过故事，要么跳过游戏。要在两者之间取得平衡，使其相互促进是很难的，而且往往不是故事太浅就是游戏太浅，无法让玩家反复玩。

* Placing players head-to-head is also a common tactic, on the grounds that other players are an endless source of new content. This is accurate, but the Mastery Problem rears its ugly head. Players hate to lose. If you fail to match them up with an opponent who is very precisely of their skill level, they'll quit.\
	让玩家正面交锋也是一种常见的策略，理由是其他玩家是无穷无尽的新内容来源。这种说法是正确的，但“掌握问题”又出现了。玩家讨厌失败。如果你不能为他们匹配一个与他们的技术水平非常接近的对手，他们就会放弃。

* Using players to generate content is a useful tactic. Many games expect players to supply the challenges in various ways, ranging from making maps for a shooter game to contributing characters in a role-playing game.\
	利用玩家创造内容是一种有用的策略。许多游戏都希望玩家以各种方式提供挑战，从为射击游戏制作地图到为角色扮演游戏贡献角色，不一而足。

But is this futile? I mean, all these designers are trying to expand the possibility space...and all the players are trying to reduce it, just as fast as they can. You see, humans are wired in some interesting ways. If something has worked for us before, we'll tend to do it again. We're really very resistant to discarding prior learning. We're conservative at heart, and we grow more so as we age. You've perhaps heard the old saw, variously attributed to Clemenceau, Churchill, and Bismarck, "If a man isn't liberal when he's 20, he has no heart. If he's not conservative when he's 40, he has no brain." Well, there's a lot of truth to this. We grow more resistant to change as we age, and we grow [less willing (and able) to learn](#user-content-fn-5)[^5].

但这是徒劳的吗？我的意思是，所有这些设计师都在试图扩大可能性空间……而所有玩家都在试图尽可能快地缩小空间。人类的思维方式很有趣。如果某件事以前对我们有用，我们就会倾向于再做一次。我们非常不愿意放弃之前的学习。我们的内心是保守的，而且随着年龄的增长，我们会变得更加保守。你也许听说过克莱蒙梭、丘吉尔和俾斯麦说过的一句老话：“如果一个人在 20 岁时还不是自由主义者，他就没有心。如果一个人到了40岁还不保守，那他就是没脑子。”这句话很有道理。随着年龄的增长，我们会越来越抗拒改变，[越来越不愿意（也越来越不能够）学习](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]。

If we come across a problem we have encountered in the past, our first approach is to try the solution that has worked before, even if the circumstances aren't exactly the same.

如果我们遇到了过去曾遇到过的问题，我们的第一反应就是尝试以前行之有效的解决方案，即使情况并不完全相同。

The problem with people isn't that they work to undermine games and make them boring. That's the natural course of events. The real problem with people is that:

人的问题并不在于他们破坏游戏，让游戏变得无聊。这是自然规律。人的真正问题在于：

    …even though our brains feed us drugs to keep us learning…

    ……尽管我们的大脑给我们喂食药物，让我们不断学习……

    …even though from earliest childhood we are trained to learn through play…

    ……尽管我们从孩提时代起就被训练在游戏中学习……

    …even though our brains send incredibly clear feedback that we should learn throughout our lives…

    ……尽管我们的大脑发出了令人难以置信的明确反馈，告诉我们应该终生学习……

    PEOPLE ARE LAZY.

    人是懒惰的。

In some ways, anyway. We're reluctant to abandon known solutions.

无论如何，在某些方面是这样。我们不愿意放弃已知的解决方案。

Look at the games that offer the absolute greatest freedom possible within the scope of a game setting. In role-playing games there are few rules. The emphasis is on collaborative storytelling. You can construct your character any way you want, use any background, and take on any challenge you like.

看看那些能在游戏设定范围内提供绝对最大自由度的游戏。在角色扮演游戏中，规则很少。游戏强调的是合作讲故事。你可以随心所欲地塑造角色，使用任何背景，接受任何挑战。

And yet, [people choose the same characters to play, over and over](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]. I've got a friend who has played the big burly silent type in literally dozens of games over the decade I have known him. Never once has he been a vivacious small girl.

然而，[人们却一次又一次地选择相同的角色进行游戏](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]。我有一个朋友，在我认识他的十几年里，他在几十款游戏中扮演的都是沉默寡言的大块头。他从来没有扮演过一个活泼的小姑娘。

Different games appeal to different personality types, and not just because particular problems appeal to certain brain types. It's also because particular solutions appeal to particular brain types, and when we've got a good thing going, we're not likely to change it. This is not a recipe for long-term success in a world that is constantly changing around us. Adaptability is key to survival.

不同的游戏会吸引不同性格类型的人，这不仅仅是因为特定的问题会吸引特定类型的大脑。这还因为特定的解决方案对特定的大脑类型有吸引力，而当我们有了一个好东西，我们就不可能去改变它。在我们周围不断变化的世界中，这不是长期成功的秘诀。适应能力是生存的关键。

Much is made of [cross-gender role-play](#user-content-fn-9)[^9] in online settings. When you look at it in this light, it's clearly because a given gender presentation is a solution choice—a tool the player is using to solve problems presented by the online game setting. It might be because the gender presentation is a good way to meet like-minded people. Males choosing female avatars may be signaling something about their preference for the company of other empathizing brains, for example. It might also be because they are simply leveraging the statistical fact that male players tend to give gifts to female ones to curry favor.

[跨性别角色扮演](#user-content-fn-10)[^10]在网络游戏中大行其道。从这个角度来看，这显然是因为特定的性别表现形式是一种解决方案的选择——玩家用来解决网络游戏环境中出现的问题的工具。也可能是因为性别表现是结识志同道合者的好方法。例如，男性选择女性化身可能表明他们更喜欢与其他具有同理心的大脑为伴。也可能是因为他们只是在利用男性玩家倾向于向女性玩家赠送礼物来讨好女性玩家这一统计事实。

Sticking to one solution is not a survival trait anymore. The world is changing very fast, and we interact with more kinds of people than ever before. The real value now lies in a wide range of experiences and in understanding a wide range of points of view. Closed-mindedness is actively dangerous to society because it leads to misapprehension. And misapprehension leads to misunderstanding, which leads to offense, which leads to violence.

墨守成规已不再是生存之道。世界瞬息万变，我们比以往任何时候都要与更多的人打交道。现在，真正的价值在于广泛的经历和对各种观点的理解。封闭的思想对社会是非常危险的，因为它会导致认知错误。而认知错误导致误解，误解导致冒犯，冒犯导致暴力。

Consider the hypothetical case where every player of an online role-playing game gets exactly two characters: one male and one female. Would the world be more or less sexist as a result?

假设每个在线角色扮演游戏的玩家都有两个角色：一男一女。这个世界的性别歧视会因此更严重还是更轻微？

[^1]: Go: The Chinese game of go is centuries old, and in many parts of the world holds much the same cultural status as chess does in the West. The game is usually played on a 19x19 grid. Players take turns placing white and black beads on the board, with the objective of surrounding a larger area than the opponent. You may also capture an opponent's bead by completely surrounding it. Go is a rich game; it has been estimated that there are more possible games of go than there are atoms in the universe. 

[^2]: 围棋：中国的围棋已有几百年的历史，在世界许多地方的文化地位与国际象棋在西方的地位差不多。围棋通常在 19x19 的方格上进行。棋手轮流在棋盘上放置白子和黑子，目标是包围比对手更大的区域。你也可以通过完全包围对手的棋子来吃掉它。围棋是一种内容丰富的游戏；据估计，可能的围棋对局数量比宇宙中的原子还要多。

[^3]: Emergent behavior: The concept of emergence recurs in fields like chaos theory, artificial life, and cellular automata, which are all mathematical systems in which very simple rules lead to behavior that is realistic or unpredictable. Steven Johnson's book Emergence (Scribner, reprinted 2002) covers this topic fairly thoroughly.

[^4]: 涌现行为：涌现的概念在混沌理论、人工生命和细胞自动机等领域反复出现，在这些数学系统中，非常简单的规则会导致现实或不可预测的行为。史蒂文·约翰逊的《涌现》（Scribner，2002 年再版）一书对这一主题进行了深入探讨。

[^5]: Less able to learn as we age: In general, psychological studies have shown that inductive reasoning and information processing (so-called "fluid intelligence") decrease as we age. However, verbal abilities and other forms of "crystallized intelligence" tend to remain constant.

[^6]: 随着年龄的增长，学习能力下降：一般来说，心理学研究表明，随着年龄的增长，归纳推理和信息处理能力（即所谓的“流体智力”）会下降。然而，语言能力和其他形式的“固化智力”往往保持不变。

[^7]: Choose the same characters to play: The tendency of players to repeatedly choose similar characters in online RPGs is verified in my own research, and can also be observed in playstyle choices revealed in the work of Dr. Nick Yee and other researchers of MMORPG social structures.

[^8]: 选择相同的角色进行游戏：玩家在在线 RPG 游戏中反复选择相似角色的倾向在我自己的研究中得到了验证，在尼克·易博士和其他 MMORPG 社会结构研究者的研究中也可以观察到玩家的游戏风格选择。

[^9]: Cross-gender role-play: There have been many papers written about cross-gender role-play. Males tend to do it far more often than females do, and given the choice, males will rarely choose a gender-neutral presentation, whereas females are more willing. Cross-gender role-play in online games is not an indicator of gender dysphoria in real life.

[^10]: 跨性别角色扮演：关于跨性别角色扮演的论文很多。男性进行跨性别角色扮演的频率远高于女性，如果可以选择，男性很少会选择不分性别的表现形式，而女性则更愿意这样做。网络游戏中的跨性别角色扮演并不代表现实生活中的性别障碍。
