The holy grail of game system design is to make a game where the challenges are never ending, the skills required are varied, and the difficulty curve is perfect and adjusts itself to exactly our skill level. Someone did this already, though, and it's not always fun. It's called "life." Maybe you've played it.

游戏系统设计的圣杯是制作一款挑战永无止境、所需技能多种多样、难度曲线完美且能根据我们的技能水平自动调整的游戏。不过已经有人做到了，但并不总是有趣的。这就是“生活”。也许你已经玩过了。

Designers often feel proudest of designing good abstract systems that have deep self-generating challenges—games like chess, [go](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], and Othello, and so on. Designing rule sets and making all the content is hard! That hasn't stopped us from trying all sorts of tactics to make games self-refreshing:

设计者通常最引以为豪的是设计出优秀的抽象系统，这些系统具有深刻的自我挑战性——比如国际象棋、[围棋](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]、和黑白棋等等。设计规则集和制作所有内容都很难！但这并不妨碍我们尝试各种策略，让游戏自我刷新：

* **"[Emergent behavior](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]"** is a common buzzword. The goal is new patterns that emerge spontaneously out of the rules, allowing the player to do things that the designer did not foresee. (Players do things designers don't expect all the time, but we don't like to talk about it.) Emergence has proven a tough nut to crack in game design; it usually makes games easier, often by generating loopholes and exploits.\
	**“[涌现行为](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]”** 是一个常用的流行语。我们的目标是从规则中自发产生新的模式，让玩家做出设计者没有预料到的事情。(玩家经常会做出设计者意想不到的事情，但我们不喜欢谈论它）。事实证明，在游戏设计中，“涌现”是一个难以破解的难题；它通常会让游戏变得更简单，往往是通过产生漏洞和钻空子的方式。

* **We also hear a lot about storytelling.** It's easier to construct a story with multiple possible interpretations than it is to construct a game with the same characteristics. However, most games melded with stories tend to be Frankenstein monsters. Players tend to either skip the story or skip the game. Balancing the two so that they reinforce each other is hard, and often either the story or the game ends up too shallow for repeated play.\
	**我们还经常听到讲故事的说法。** 构建一个有多种可能诠释的故事比构建一个具有相同特点的游戏要容易得多。然而，大多数与故事相融合的游戏往往是科学怪人。玩家往往要么跳过故事，要么跳过游戏。要在两者之间取得平衡，使其相互促进是很难的，而且往往不是故事太浅就是游戏太浅，无法让玩家反复玩。

[^1]: Go: The Chinese game of go is centuries old, and in many parts of the world holds much the same cultural status as chess does in the West. The game is usually played on a 19x19 grid. Players take turns placing white and black beads on the board, with the objective of surrounding a larger area than the opponent. You may also capture an opponent’s bead by completely surrounding it. Go is a rich game; it has been estimated that there are more possible games of go than there are atoms in the universe. 

[^2]: 围棋：中国的围棋已有几百年的历史，在世界许多地方的文化地位与国际象棋在西方的地位差不多。围棋通常在 19x19 的方格上进行。棋手轮流在棋盘上放置白子和黑子，目标是包围比对手更大的区域。你也可以通过完全包围对手的棋子来吃掉它。围棋是一种内容丰富的游戏；据估计，可能的围棋对局数量比宇宙中的原子还要多。

[^3]: Emergent behavior: The concept of emergence recurs in fields like chaos theory, artificial life, and cellular automata, which are all mathematical systems in which very simple rules lead to behavior that is realistic or unpredictable. Steven Johnson’s book Emergence (Scribner, reprinted 2002) covers this topic fairly thoroughly.

[^4]: 涌现行为：涌现的概念在混沌理论、人工生命和细胞自动机等领域反复出现，在这些数学系统中，非常简单的规则会导致现实或不可预测的行为。史蒂文·约翰逊的《涌现》（Scribner，2002 年再版）一书对这一主题进行了深入探讨。
