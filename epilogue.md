# Epilogue Fun Matters, Grandpa 后记 快乐很重要，祖父

It's been a long journey for me, and I don't doubt that as my kids continue to grow, it will seem even longer.

对我来说，这是一段漫长的旅程，我毫不怀疑，随着孩子们的不断成长，这段旅程会显得更加漫长。

I have watched them start to learn the concepts of respect for one another.

我看着他们开始学习互相尊重的概念。

I have watched them understand that resources are limited and that things must be shared.

我看到他们明白资源是有限的，东西必须共享。

Every day, they connect an astounding number of new neurons; they learn a flabbergasting number of new words, and they develop in ways I can barely remember and barely glimpse.

每天，他们连接着数量惊人的新神经元；他们学习着数量惊人的新单词；他们的成长方式我几乎无法记住，也几乎无法瞥见。

Games are helping them along that path, and for that I am grateful. I'm not immune to the desire that my children be better off, after all, and I'll take any tool that helps us along that path.

游戏帮助他们在这条道路上前行，对此我心怀感激。毕竟，我也希望我的孩子能过得更好，我愿意接受任何能帮助我们实现这一愿望的工具。

A lot of old age is attributable to losing neurons, losing connections, losing the patterns we have built up, settling into fewer and fewer until all we can do is stand by helplessly as the world dissolves into noise around us. We'd all be better off if we kept our minds limber by pushing them to always tackle new problems.

人到老年，很多时候都是因为神经元衰退、失去联系、失去我们建立起来的模式，越来越少，直到我们只能无助地站在一旁，看着周围的世界化为噪音。如果我们能让自己的大脑保持灵活，不断解决新的问题，那么我们都会过得更好。

Not too long before my grandfather died, he told me, "I'm thinking of getting one of those computer things. It doesn't seem like the Internet is all that different from ham radio. Maybe I'll give it a try."

在我祖父去世前不久，他告诉我：“我想买一台电脑。互联网和业余无线电似乎没什么不同。也许我会试一试。”

I learned of my grandfather's passing when I arrived at a hotel in San Jose, where I was attending the annual Game Developers Conference. Somehow it seemed apropos.

我是在抵达圣何塞的一家酒店时得知祖父去世的消息的。我当时正在参加一年一度的游戏开发者大会。不知为何，这似乎恰如其分。

The questions he posed, in the wake of shootings at Columbine High School, at a time when the world was suddenly making little sense, are fair questions. Are games a tool for evil? Or for good? Are they frivolous at best, or frivolous at worst?

在哥伦拜恩高中发生枪击案之后，在世界突然变得毫无意义的时候，他提出的问题是很合理的。游戏是邪恶的工具吗？还是善良的工具？游戏在最好的情况下是无聊的，还是在最坏的情况下是轻浮的？

It seems important that we know the answers, not just to allow those of us who work in this field to sleep better at night, but also in order to reassure those who watch us work: our families, our friends, our cultures.

问题的答案似乎非常重要，这不仅让我们这些在该领域工作的人晚上能睡得更安心，而且也是为了让那些关注我们工作的人——我们的家人、朋友和文化——放心。

Games fit in the spectrum of human activity. Human activity is not always pretty. It’s not always noble. It’s not always altruistic. And a lot of really dumb things are done in games. A lot of dumb things are done by people playing games. A lot of dumb things are done by those making games.

游戏是人类活动的一部分。人类活动并不总是美好的。并不总是高尚的。也不总是利他主义的 游戏中也有很多蠢事 很多蠢事都是玩游戏的人干的 制作游戏的人也做了很多蠢事

But ignorance can be rectified. Human activity may be driven by selfish genes, by the phantasms of inaccurate perception, or by reactionary tribalism and shortsighted dominance moves.

但无知是可以纠正的。人类活动的驱动力可能是自私的基因，可能是不准确认知的幻觉，也可能是反动的部落主义和短视的统治行为。

But there are those firemen, those special education teachers, those architects, who are out there working. They’re building spaces in which we can live safely and rear our children.

但是，那些消防员、那些特殊教育教师、那些建筑师，他们都在外面工作。他们在建造我们可以安全生活和养育孩子的空间。

I’ve put forth what may seem like a mechanistic view of the world in this book, one that would perhaps run contrary to my grandfather’s deeply held religious faith. And yet I think that we would both come to the same conclusion:

我在这本书中提出了一个看似机械的世界观，这或许与我祖父深厚的宗教信仰背道而驰。但我认为，我们都会得出同样的结论：

Any striving for understanding that we do is likely to hold back the darkness. The new may scare us, as when symphonies with odd harmonies cause riots 
among disturbed music lovers…

我们所做的任何理解努力都可能会阻碍黑暗的到来。新事物可能会让我们感到恐惧，就像带有奇怪和声的交响乐会在不安的音乐爱好者中引起骚乱一样

But time smoothes things over. And we are left with beautiful music.

但时间会抚平一切 留给我们的是美妙的音乐。

So my answer here is, I am willing to choose which side of human nature I want to foster.

所以我的答案是，我愿意选择我想要培养的人性的哪一面。
