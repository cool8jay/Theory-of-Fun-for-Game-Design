INTRODUCTION II

序言二

The life of Del Close is virtually a history of American improvisation.

德尔·克洛斯的一生几乎就是一部美国即兴表演史。

Del started his comedy career with Mike Nichols and Elaine May in the Compass Players in St. Louis during the 1950s.* Moving on to Second City and San Francisco's legendary Committee, Del returned to Second City in time to direct successes like John Belushi and Bill Murray. In fact, there are very few successful improvisers who have not worked with or been influenced by Del's work.

德尔的喜剧生涯始于 20 世纪 50 年代，当时他与迈克·尼科尔斯和伊莱恩·梅一起在圣路易斯的“指南针剧团”演出*。之后，他又前往 “第二城”（Second City）和旧金山的传奇剧团 “委员会”演出。之后又回到第二城，指导出了像约翰·贝鲁西和比尔·默瑞这样的成功演员。事实上，很少有成功的即兴表演者没有与德尔合作过或没有受到过德尔作品的影响。

Although Del has worked on stage and screen throughout the years, he has been teaching or directing improv almost continuously since the 1950s and continues into the '90s.

虽然德尔多年来一直在舞台和银幕上工作，但自 20 世纪 50 年代以来，他几乎一直在教学或指导即兴表演，并一直持续到 90 年代。

Ed Asner, who began improvising in the '50s in the Playwright's Theatre Club at the University of Chicago, calls Del "a mad genius." Chris Farley, who joined Saturday Night Live after working with Del in the ImprovOlympic, says, "Del is the greatest teacher I've ever known. I would not be where I am today were it not for Del, that's for sure. I owe everything to Del. He brought me to Second City, and he taught me everything I needed to know."

艾德·阿斯纳从 50 年代开始在芝加哥大学“剧作家戏剧俱乐部”即兴表演，他称德尔为“疯狂的天才”。克里斯·法利在即兴奥林匹克中与德尔合作后加入了《周六夜现场》，他说：“德尔是我认识的最伟大的老师。如果没有德尔，就没有今天的我，这是肯定的。我的一切都归功于德尔。是他把我带到了第二城，是他教会了我所需要知道的一切。”

Del's partner, Charna Halpern, was working with Compass Players founder David Shepherd in the early '80s in Chicago. When they went their separate ways, Charna joined forces with Del, and they began operating the ImprovOlympic. Their classes have turned out hundreds and hundreds of accomplished performers.

德尔的搭档查尔纳·哈尔彭在 80 年代初曾在芝加哥与“指南针剧团”创始人大卫·谢泼德共事。当他们分道扬镳后，查尔纳与德尔联手，开始经营即兴奥林匹克。他们的课程培养出了成百上千的优秀表演者。

My own background in the early '80s included a fervent interest in comedy writing and performing; I had long been a fan of Saturday Night Live (where most of the performers had been directly influenced by Del) and Monty Python, becoming friends with the latter (working with them on Life of Brian and subsequently writing three books on the group).

我自己在 80 年代初的背景包括对喜剧创作和表演的狂热兴趣；我长期以来一直是《周六夜现场》（其中大多数表演者都受到了德尔的直接影响）和《巨蟒》的粉丝，并与后者成为了朋友（与他们合作拍摄了《布莱恩的生活》，随后写了三本关于该团体的书）。
