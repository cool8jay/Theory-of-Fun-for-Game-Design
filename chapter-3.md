Which brings us, finally, to games.

最后，我们来谈谈游戏。

If you review those definitions of "game" I presented earlier, you'll see that they have some elements in common. They all present games as if they exist within a world of their own. They describe games as a simulation, a formal system, or as Huizinga put it, a "magic circle" that is disconnected from reality. They all talk about how choices or rules are important, as well as conflict. Finally, a lot of
them define games as objects that aren't real, things for pretending with.

如果你回顾一下我前面介绍的那些关于“游戏”的定义，就会发现它们有一些共同之处。它们都把游戏说成是存在于自己的世界中。它们都把游戏描述为一种模拟、一种形式系统，或者如赫伊津哈所说，是一个与现实脱节的 “魔法圈”。他们都谈到了选择或规则以及冲突的重要性。最后，他们中的很多人都把游戏定义为不真实的物体，是用来假装的东西。

But games are very real to me. Games might seem abstracted from reality because they are iconic depictions of patterns in the world. They have more in common with how our brain visualizes things than they do with how reality is actually formed. Since [our perception of reality is basically abstraction](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] anyway, I call it a wash.

但对我来说，游戏是非常真实的。游戏看似从现实中抽象出来，因为它们是对世界模式的标志性描述。它们与我们大脑将事物视觉化的方式有更多共通之处，而不是与现实的实际形成方式有更多共通之处。既然[我们对现实的感知基本上都是抽象的](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]，我称之为洗脑。

The pattern depicted may or may not exist in reality. Nobody is claiming that tic-tac-toe is a decent mimicry of warfare, for example. But the rules we perceive—what I'll call the pattern—get processed exactly the same way we process very real things like "fire burns" and "how cars move forward."

所描述的模式在现实中可能存在，也可能不存在。例如，没有人说井字游戏是对战争的完美模仿。但我们感知到的规则——我称之为模式——的处理方式与我们处理“火会燃烧”和“汽车如何前进”等真实事物的方式完全相同。

The world is full of systems that we can choose to approach as games, and by approaching them that way, we make them into games. Games are puzzles to solve, just like everything else we encounter in life. They are on the same order as learning to drive a car, play the mandolin, or multiply seven times seven. We learn the underlying patterns, grok them fully, and file them away so that they can be rerun as needed. The only real difference between games and reality is that the stakes are lower with games.

这个世界充满了各种系统，我们可以选择把它们当作游戏来处理，通过这样的处理方式，我们把它们变成了游戏。游戏是需要解决的谜题，就像我们在生活中遇到的其他事情一样。它们与学习驾驶汽车、弹曼陀林或计算 7 乘以 7 的顺序相同。我们学习其基本模式，完全领悟它们，并将它们归档，以便在需要时重新运行。游戏与现实的唯一真正区别在于，游戏的风险较低。

Games are something special and unique. They are concentrated chunks ready for our brains to chew on. Since they are abstracted and iconic, they are readily absorbed. Since they are formal systems, they exclude distracting extra details. Usually, our brains have to do hard work to turn messy reality into something as clear as a game is.

游戏是一种特殊而独特的东西。它们是可供我们大脑咀嚼的浓缩块。由于它们是抽象的、标志性的，因此很容易被吸收。由于它们是形式系统，因此舍弃了分散注意力的额外细节。通常情况下，我们的大脑需要做艰苦的工作，才能把杂乱无章的现实变成像游戏一样清晰的东西。

In other words, games serve as very fundamental and powerful learning tools. It's one thing to read in a book that "the map is not the territory"* and another to have your armies rolled over by your opponent in a game. When the latter happens because your map didn't adequately reflect what was going on, you're gonna get the point even if the actual armies aren't marching into your suburban home.

换句话说，游戏是非常基本和强大的学习工具。在书中读到“地图不是领土”是一回事，而在游戏中你的军队被对手辗过又是另一回事。当后者发生时，是因为你的地图没有充分反映当时的情况，即使真正的军队没有开进你郊区的家，你也会明白这一点。

The distinctions between toys and games, or between play and sport, start to seem a bit picky and irrelevant when you look at them in this light. There's been a lot of hay made over how play is non-goal-oriented and games tend to have goals; over how toys are aimed at pointless play rather than being games; about how make-believe is a form of play and not a game.

从这个角度看，玩具与游戏、游戏与运动之间的区别就开始显得有些挑剔和无关紧要了。游戏是非目标导向的，而游戏往往是有目标的；玩具的目的是无意义的游戏，而不是游戏；虚构是游戏的一种形式，而不是游戏。

A game designer might find those distinctions useful because they provide helpful guideposts. But all these things are the same at their most fundamental level. Perhaps this is the reason why language hasn't done a very good job of making distinctions between "play,” "game,” and "sport.” Playing a goal-oriented game involves simply recognizing a particular sort of pattern; playing make-believe is recognizing another one. Both deservedly belong in the same category of "iconified representations of human experience that we can practice with and learn patterns from.”

游戏设计师可能会觉得这些区别很有用，因为它们提供了有益的指导。但所有这些东西在最根本的层面上都是一样的。也许这就是为什么语言没有很好地区分 “游戏”、“游戏 ”和 “运动 ”的原因。玩一种以目标为导向的游戏，只涉及识别一种特定的模式；而玩 “虚幻 ”游戏则是识别另一种模式。两者当之无愧地属于同一类 “人类经验的图标化表征，我们可以从中练习和学习模式”。

Consider the key difference between something like a book and different kinds of games. A book can do the logical conscious part of the brain pretty well. And really good readers have an ability to slurp that info directly into the subconscious, intuitive mind. But what a book will never be able to do is accelerate the grokking process to the degree that games do, because you cannot practice a pattern and run permutations on it with a book, and have the book respond with feedback. *

考虑一下像书这样的东西与不同种类的游戏之间的主要区别。一本书可以很好地完成大脑的逻辑意识部分。而真正优秀的读者有能力将这些信息直接输入潜意识、直觉思维。但书永远无法做到的是，像游戏那样加速摸索过程，因为你无法用一本书来练习一个模式并对其进行排列组合，然后让书做出反馈。*

[^1]: Our perception of reality is basically abstraction: An important paper called "What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain," by Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch, and Pitts, described the fact that what the brain "sees" as output from the eyes is not even vaguely close to the literal visual image. A significant amount of processing turns the literal input of light and shadow into something that the brain copes with. In a very real sense, we do not see the world—we see what our brain tells us we see. Solipsism is five blocks down and to the left.

[^2]: 我们对现实的感知基本上是抽象的：莱特文、马图拉纳、麦克库洛赫和皮茨的一篇重要论文《青蛙的眼睛告诉青蛙的大脑什么》描述了这样一个事实：大脑从眼睛中“看到”的输出与字面上的视觉图像相差甚远。大量的处理过程将光影的直接输入转化为大脑可以应对的东西。从真正意义上说，我们看到的不是世界，而是大脑告诉我们看到了什么。唯我论就在左下方五个街区的地方。
