Which brings us, finally, to games.

最后，我们来谈谈游戏。

If you review those definitions of "game" I presented earlier, you'll see that they have some elements in common. They all present games as if they exist within a world of their own. They describe games as a simulation, a formal system, or as Huizinga put it, a "magic circle" that is disconnected from reality. They all talk about how choices or rules are important, as well as conflict. Finally, a lot of
them define games as objects that aren't real, things for pretending with.

如果你回顾一下我前面介绍的那些关于“游戏”的定义，就会发现它们有一些共同之处。它们都把游戏说成是存在于自己的世界中。它们都把游戏描述为一种模拟、一种形式系统，或者如赫伊津哈所说，是一个与现实脱节的 “魔法圈”。他们都谈到了选择或规则以及冲突的重要性。最后，他们中的很多人都把游戏定义为不真实的物体，是用来假装的东西。

But games are very real to me. Games might seem abstracted from reality because they are iconic depictions of patterns in the world. They have more in common with how our brain visualizes things than they do with how reality is actually formed. Since [our perception of reality is basically abstraction](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] anyway, I call it a wash.

但对我来说，游戏是非常真实的。游戏看似从现实中抽象出来，因为它们是对世界模式的标志性描述。它们与我们大脑将事物视觉化的方式有更多共通之处，而不是与现实的实际形成方式有更多共通之处。既然[我们对现实的感知基本上都是抽象的](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]，我称之为洗脑。

The pattern depicted may or may not exist in reality. Nobody is claiming that tic-tac-toe is a decent mimicry of warfare, for example. But the rules we perceive—what I'll call the pattern—get processed exactly the same way we process very real things like "fire burns" and "how cars move forward."

所描述的模式在现实中可能存在，也可能不存在。例如，没有人说井字游戏是对战争的完美模仿。但我们感知到的规则——我称之为模式——的处理方式与我们处理“火会燃烧”和“汽车如何前进”等真实事物的方式完全相同。

The world is full of systems that we can choose to approach as games, and by approaching them that way, we make them into games. Games are puzzles to solve, just like everything else we encounter in life. They are on the same order as learning to drive a car, play the mandolin, or multiply seven times seven. We learn the underlying patterns, grok them fully, and file them away so that they can be rerun as needed. The only real difference between games and reality is that the stakes are lower with games.

这个世界充满了各种系统，我们可以选择把它们当作游戏来处理，通过这样的处理方式，我们把它们变成了游戏。游戏是需要解决的谜题，就像我们在生活中遇到的其他事情一样。它们与学习驾驶汽车、弹曼陀林或计算 7 乘以 7 的顺序相同。我们学习其基本模式，完全领悟它们，并将它们归档，以便在需要时重新运行。游戏与现实的唯一真正区别在于，游戏的风险较低。

[^1]: Our perception of reality is basically abstraction: An important paper called "What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain," by Lettvin, Maturana, McCulloch, and Pitts, described the fact that what the brain "sees" as output from the eyes is not even vaguely close to the literal visual image. A significant amount of processing turns the literal input of light and shadow into something that the brain copes with. In a very real sense, we do not see the world—we see what our brain tells us we see. Solipsism is five blocks down and to the left.

[^2]: 我们对现实的感知基本上是抽象的：莱特文、马图拉纳、麦克库洛赫和皮茨的一篇重要论文《青蛙的眼睛告诉青蛙的大脑什么》描述了这样一个事实：大脑从眼睛中“看到”的输出与字面上的视觉图像相差甚远。大量的处理过程将光影的直接输入转化为大脑可以应对的东西。从真正意义上说，我们看到的不是世界，而是大脑告诉我们看到了什么。唯我论就在左下方五个街区的地方。
