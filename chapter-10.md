Nobody actually interacts with games on an abstract level exclusively. You don't play the abstract diagrams of games that I have drawn on the facing pages; you play the ones that have little spaceships and laser bolts and things that go BOOM! The core of gameplay may be about the emotion I am terming "fun," the emotion that is about learning puzzles and mastering responses to situations, but this doesn't mean that the other sorts of things we lump under fun do not contribute to the overall experience.

实际上，没有人只在抽象层面上与游戏互动。你不会去玩我在对面页面上画的抽象游戏图；你玩的是那些有小飞船、激光枪和会发出“轰！”声的东西的游戏。游戏玩法的核心可能与我所说的“乐趣”这种情感有关，这种情感是关于学习谜题和掌握应对各种情境的方法，但这并不意味着我们归类到乐趣下的其他各种事物对整体体验没有贡献。

People like playing go using well-burnished beads on a wooden board, and they like buying Lord of the Rings chess sets and glass Chinese checkers sets. The aesthetic experience of playing these games matters. When you pick up a well-carved wooden game piece, you respond to it in terms of aesthetic appreciation—one of the other forms of enjoyment. When you play table tennis against an opponent, you feel visceral sensations as you stretch your arm to the limit and smash the ball against the table surface. And when you slap the back of your teammate, congratulating him on his field goal, you're participating in the subtle social dance that marks the constant human exercise of social status.

人们喜欢在木板上用精心烧制的珠子下围棋，喜欢购买《指环王》主题的国际象棋和中国玻璃跳棋。玩这些游戏的审美体验非常重要。当你拿起一个雕刻精美的木制棋子时，你会从审美欣赏的角度对它做出反应——这也是其他形式的享受。当你与对手打乒乓球时，当你将手臂伸展到极限并将球砸向桌面时，你会感受到直观的感觉。而当你拍打队友的后背，祝贺他射门得分时，你正在参与微妙的社交舞蹈，这标志着人类不断的社交地位实践。

We know this from other media. It matters who sings a song because delivery is important. We treasure nice editions of books, rather than cheap ones, even though the semantic content is identical. Rock climbing a real rock face, versus a fake one attached to a wall, feels different.

我们从其他媒介中了解到这一点。谁唱一首歌很重要，因为表达方式很重要。我们珍视好版本的书籍，而不是廉价版本的书籍，尽管它们的文字内容完全相同。攀岩是攀爬真正的岩壁，还是攀爬附着在墙上的假岩壁，感觉是不同的。

In many media, the presentation factors are outside the hands of the initial creator of the content. But in other media, the creator has a say. Often, we have a specific person whose role it is to create the overall experience, as opposed to the content itself. And rightfully, this person is given higher authority over the final output than the content creator alone. The director trumps the writer in a movie, and the conductor trumps the composer in a symphony.

在许多媒介中，内容呈现的因素并不在内容最初创作者的掌控之中。但在其他媒介中，创作者却有发言权。通常情况下，我们有一个特定的人，他的职责是创造整体体验，而不是内容本身。理所当然，这个人在最终产出上比内容创作者一个人拥有更高的权力。在电影中，导演高于编剧，在交响乐中，指挥高于作曲家。

There is a difference between designing the content and designing the end-user experience.

设计内容和设计最终用户体验是不同的。

Game design teams are set up this way, too. Too many other components have tremendous importance in our overall experience of games for their overall shape to rest in the hands of the designers of ludic artifacts alone.

游戏设计团队也是这样组建的。在我们对游戏的整体体验中，有太多其他的组成部分具有巨大的重要性，因此游戏的整体形态不能仅仅掌握在游戏人工制品设计师的手中。

Players see through the fiction to the underlying mechanics, but that does not mean the fiction is unimportant. Consider films, where the goal is typically for the many conventions, tricks, and mind-shapings that the camera performs to remain invisible and unperceived by the viewer. It's rare that a film tries to call attention to the gymnastics of the camera, and when it does, it will likely be to make some specific point. For example, cinematographers and directors frame conversations by placing the camera slightly over the shoulder of whoever is listening at the time. This creates psychological proximity. If done well, the audience never notices that the two sides of the conversation were filmed separately. This is part of the "vocabulary" of cinema.

玩家可以透过表象看到潜在的机制，但这并不意味着表象不重要。就拿电影来说，电影的目标通常是让摄影机所表现的许多惯例、技巧和思维定势不被观众察觉。很少有电影会试图唤起观众对摄影机技巧的关注，即使有，也很可能是为了表达某种特定的观点。例如，摄影师和导演会将镜头稍稍放在当时正在倾听的人的肩膀上，以此来定格对话。这样就会产生心理上的接近感。如果做得好，观众永远不会注意到对话的双方是分开拍摄的。这是电影“语汇”的一部分。

For better or worse, visual representation and metaphor are part of the vocabulary of games. When we describe a game, we almost never do so in terms of the formal abstract system alone; we describe it in terms of the overall experience.

无论好坏，视觉表现和隐喻都是游戏语汇的一部分。当我们描述一款游戏时，我们几乎从不单单从形式上抽象系统来描述，而是从整体体验的角度来描述。

The dressing is tremendously important. It's very likely that chess would not have its long-term appeal if the pieces all represented different kinds of snot.

着装非常重要。如果棋子都代表不同种类的鼻涕，国际象棋很可能就不会有长期的吸引力。
