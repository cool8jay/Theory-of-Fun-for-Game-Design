Nobody actually interacts with games on an abstract level exclusively. You don't play the abstract diagrams of games that I have drawn on the facing pages; you play the ones that have little spaceships and laser bolts and things that go BOOM! The core of gameplay may be about the emotion I am terming "fun," the emotion that is about learning puzzles and mastering responses to situations, but this doesn't mean that the other sorts of things we lump under fun do not contribute to the overall experience.

实际上，没有人只在抽象层面上与游戏互动。你不会去玩我在对面页面上画的抽象游戏图；你玩的是那些有小飞船、激光枪和会发出“轰！”声的东西的游戏。游戏玩法的核心可能与我所说的“乐趣”这种情感有关，这种情感是关于学习谜题和掌握应对各种情境的方法，但这并不意味着我们归类到乐趣下的其他各种事物对整体体验没有贡献。

People like playing go using well-burnished beads on a wooden board, and they like buying Lord of the Rings chess sets and glass Chinese checkers sets. The aesthetic experience of playing these games matters. When you pick up a well-carved wooden game piece, you respond to it in terms of aesthetic appreciation—one of the other forms of enjoyment. When you play table tennis against an opponent, you feel visceral sensations as you stretch your arm to the limit and smash the ball against the table surface. And when you slap the back of your teammate, congratulating him on his field goal, you're participating in the subtle social dance that marks the constant human exercise of social status.

人们喜欢在木板上用精心烧制的珠子下围棋，喜欢购买《指环王》主题的国际象棋和中国玻璃跳棋。玩这些游戏的审美体验非常重要。当你拿起一个雕刻精美的木制棋子时，你会从审美欣赏的角度对它做出反应——这也是其他形式的享受。当你与对手打乒乓球时，当你将手臂伸展到极限并将球砸向桌面时，你会感受到直观的感觉。而当你拍打队友的后背，祝贺他射门得分时，你正在参与微妙的社交舞蹈，这标志着人类不断的社交地位实践。

We know this from other media. It matters who sings a song because delivery is important. We treasure nice editions of books, rather than cheap ones, even though the semantic content is identical. Rock climbing a real rock face, versus a fake one attached to a wall, feels different.

我们从其他媒体中了解到这一点。谁唱一首歌很重要，因为表达方式很重要。我们珍视好版本的书籍，而不是廉价版本的书籍，尽管它们的文字内容完全相同。攀岩是攀爬真正的岩壁，还是攀爬附着在墙上的假岩壁，感觉是不同的。
