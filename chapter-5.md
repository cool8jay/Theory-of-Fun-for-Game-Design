Until now, I've been discussing formal game design—abstract simulations. I've also been pretty loose with the term "game," conflating game systems with games. But we rarely see truly abstract simulations in games. People tend to dress up game systems with some fiction. Designers put artwork on them that is suggestive of some real-world context. Take checkers for example—abstractly, it's a board game about entrapment and forced action, played on a diamond-shaped grid. When we say ["king me"](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] in checkers, we're adding a subtle bit of fiction to the game; suddenly it has acquired feudal overtones and a medieval context. Usually, the pieces have a crown embossed on them.

截至目前，我一直在讨论正式的游戏设计——抽象的模拟。我对“游戏”一词的使用也很随意，把游戏系统和游戏混为一谈。但我们很少在游戏中看到真正抽象的模拟。人们往往会用一些虚构的东西来装扮游戏系统。设计者会在游戏中加入一些艺术元素，让人联想到现实世界中的一些场景。以跳棋为例——抽象地看，这是一种在菱形棋盘上进行的关于围捕和强制行动的棋盘游戏。当我们在跳棋中说[“升王”](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]时，我们就给这个游戏添加了一点微妙的虚构成分；突然间，它就有了封建色彩和中世纪背景。通常情况下，棋子上会刻上王冠图案。

This is similar to word problems in math class. The fiction serves two purposes: it trains you to see past it to the underlying math problem, and it also trains you to recognize real-world situations where that math problem might be lurking. 

这类似于数学课上的文字题。虚构有两个目的：一是训练你透过虚构看到潜在的数学问题，二是训练你识别现实世界中可能潜伏着数学问题的情况。

Games in general tend to be like word problems. You won't find many games that are pure unclothed [abstractions](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. Most games have more in common with chess or checkers—they provide some level of misdirection. Usually there are metaphors for what is going on in the game.

一般来说，游戏往往就像文字题。你不会找到很多纯粹的[抽象游戏](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]。大多数游戏与国际象棋或跳棋有更多的共同之处——它们提供了某种程度的误导。通常游戏中发生的事情都有一些隐喻。

While metaphors are fun to play with, players can basically ignore them. The name of the unique checker piece that has made it to the other side is irrelevant, mathematically speaking. We could call the regular pieces chickens and the crowned ones wolves and the game would not change one whit.

虽然隐喻很有趣，但玩家基本上可以忽略它们。从数学角度讲，到达另一方的独特跳棋棋子的名称是无关紧要的。我们可以把普通棋子叫做鸡，把有王冠的棋子叫做狼，而游戏却丝毫不会改变。

Games, by the very nature of what they teach, push towards this sort of understanding. Since they are about teaching underlying patterns, they train their players to ignore the fiction that wraps the patterns.

游戏根据它们所教授的内容的本质，推动了这种理解的形成。由于它们的目的是教授底层模式，所以他们训练玩家忽略包裹这些模式的虚构元素。

Back in 1976, a company called Exidy scored a first in video game history: its game [Deathrace](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] was taken off the market because of public concerns about the game's violent nature. Deathrace was loosely based on a movie called [Deathrace 2000](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. The premise involved driving a car to run over pedestrians for points.

早在 1976 年，一家名为 Exidy 的公司创造了视频游戏史上的一个第一：其游戏[《死亡飞车》](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]因公众对游戏暴力性质的担忧而被下架。《死亡飞车》是根据一部名为[《死亡飞车 2000》](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]的电影改编的。游戏的前提是驾驶汽车碾压行人以获得分数。

Mechanically, Deathrace was the same as any other game that involved catching objects moving around the screen. If you looked at this game today, with its crude pixelated graphics and its tiny iconic people, you wouldn't be particularly shocked. After all, countless other gore-fests have come along that make the game look quaint.

从机制上讲，《死亡飞车》与其他任何涉及捕捉屏幕上移动物体的游戏一样。如果你今天来看看这款游戏，看看它粗糙的像素化画面和微小的标志性人物，你不会感到特别震惊。毕竟，无数其他血腥游戏的出现让这款游戏显得古色古香。

I don't think debates about the suitability of violence in the media will disappear. Much evidence shows that [media have some effect on how we act](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]. If media didn't have an effect, we wouldn't spend so much effort on using them as teaching tools. But evidence also shows that media aren't mind-control devices (of course they aren't, or else we'd all behave like the people in the children's stories we read in elementary school).

我不认为关于媒体中暴力是否合适的争论会消失。许多证据表明，[媒体对我们的行为方式有一定的影响](#user-content-fn-10)[^10]。如果媒体没有影响，我们就不会花这么多精力把它们用作教学工具。但也有证据表明，媒体并不是精神控制设备（当然不是，否则我们的行为就会像小学时读的儿童故事里的人一样）。

Gamers, however, have always viewed this issue with some perplexity. When they defend their beloved games, they use one of the most self-defeating rallying cries in history: "It's only a game!"

然而，游戏玩家对这一问题的看法总是有些令人费解。当他们为自己心爱的游戏辩护时，他们使用的是史上最不攻自破的辩护词之一：“这只是个游戏！”

In the wake of [school shootings](#user-content-fn-11)[^11] and ex-military people decrying first-person shooters as "[murder simulators](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]," this argument doesn't carry a lot of weight. Academics who disagree with the portrayal of games as damaging to children tend to muster learned arguments about privileged spaces and magic circles. Much of the public dismisses these arguments as coming from an ivory tower.

在[校园枪击案](#user-content-fn-13)[^13]和退役军人斥责第一人称射击游戏为“[谋杀模拟器](#user-content-fn-14)[^14]”之后，这种论调并不具有多少分量。不同意将游戏描绘成对儿童有害的学者们，往往会提出关于特权空间和魔法圈的学术论据。公众大多认为这些论点来自脱离现实的学术象牙塔。

But there's a very good reason why the gamers are incredulous.

但游戏玩家感到难以置信是有充分理由的。

[^1]: "King me": The phrase spoken when you move a checkers piece to the last row on the board. There's an interesting political undertone to checkers, in that it is assumed that common soldiers must only charge forward, whereas kings have more freedom of movement (and may retreat)—and yet, it is also assumed that any soldier may become a king.

[^2]: "升王"：当你把跳棋棋子移动到棋盘最后一行时说的一句话。跳棋有一个有趣的政治含义，即人们认为普通士兵只能向前冲锋，而国王则有更多的行动自由（可以后退）——然而，人们也认为任何士兵都可以成为国王。

[^3]: Abstract games: In the gamer community, religious wars occur over whether or not a game should include fictional dressing or not. There is an entire genre of abstract strategy games that is arguably not enhanced by the inclusion of back story or art treatments.

[^4]: 抽象游戏：在游戏玩家群体中，关于游戏是否应包含虚构装扮的话题，常常引发激烈争论。有这样一整类抽象游戏，可以说，这类游戏并不会因为加入背景故事或者美术设计而得到改善。

[^5]: Deathrace: This was also the first instance of a movie being adapted to a game.

[^6]: Deathrace 2000: Movie released in 1975, starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. It is about cross-country racing in the future; running over pedestrians scores points in the race, and some fans are crazed enough to throw themselves under the wheels of their favorite drivers to help them win.

[^7]: 《死亡飞车》：这也是第一次将电影改编成游戏。

[^8]: 《死亡飞车 2000》：1975年上映的电影，由大卫·卡拉丁和西尔维斯特·史泰龙主演。影片讲述的是未来越野赛车的故事；碾压行人可在比赛中得分，一些车迷为了帮助自己喜欢的车手获胜，疯狂地将自己扔到车轮下。

[^9]: Effects of media on violence: An ongoing debate among academics. Most of the evidence is limited to demonstrating a rise in aggressive behavior for a few minutes—hardly advanced mind control. Others feel that vicarious exploration of violence is natural and even a necessary part of development. For a representative look at this position, try Gerard Jones’s [Killing Monsters: Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465036953), published by Basic Books in 2003. In addition, the [American Academy of Family Physicians](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2002/0401/p1436.html) determined that there was insufficient evidence to make a link between video games and violence. There have been [studies](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13718/w13718.pdf) showing that watching violent films may actually reduce real life violent activity.

[^10]: 媒体对暴力的影响：学术界一直在争论这个问题。大多数证据仅限于证明攻击性行为会在几分钟内增加——这还算不上高级精神控制。另一些人则认为，对暴力的代入性探索是自然的，甚至是成长的必要组成部分。要了解这种观点的代表作，请阅读杰拉德·琼斯的[《杀死怪物：为什么儿童需要幻想、超级英雄和虚构的暴力》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465036953) ，该书于 2003 年由 Basic Books 出版。此外，[美国家庭医生学会](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2002/0401/p1436.html)认为，没有足够的证据表明电子游戏与暴力之间存在联系。有[研究](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13718/w13718.pdf)表明，观看暴力电影实际上可以减少现实生活中的暴力活动。

[^11]: School shootings: Several school shootings have been blamed on the effects of video games. There have also been cases of criminals claiming inspiration from acts of crime in video games. The industry’s position is that games are an art form and worthy of protection under the First Amendment, and that the responsibility for keeping violent media out of the hands of children rests with parents. In addition, several statistics can be cited to buttress the opinion that video games do not have a significant effect on violent crime; for example, the incidence of violent crime has fallen dramatically just as the popularity of video games has risen. Were there a causal link, one would expect the two to rise in tandem.

[^12]: Murder simulators: The most outspoken advocate of the point of view that media and video games cause violent behavior is Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, the author of [Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0804139350), published by Crown Books in 1999. The term "murder simulators" is his.

[^13]: 校园枪击案：多起校园枪击案被归咎于电子游戏的影响。也有罪犯声称从电子游戏中的犯罪行为中获得灵感。游戏业的立场是，游戏是一种艺术形式，值得受到第一修正案的保护，而不让儿童接触暴力媒体的责任在于家长。此外，还可以引用一些统计数据来证明电子游戏对暴力犯罪没有显著影响的观点；例如，随着电子游戏的普及，暴力犯罪的发生率急剧下降。如果两者之间存在因果关系，人们就会认为两者会同步上升。

[^14]: 谋杀模拟器：戴夫·格罗斯曼中校是媒体和电子游戏导致暴力行为这一观点最直率的拥护者，他是[《停止教孩子杀人：反对电视、电影和电子游戏暴力的行动呼吁》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0804139350)的作者：该书由 Crown Books 于 1999 年出版。“谋杀模拟器”一词就是他提出的。
