Until now, I've been discussing formal game design—abstract simulations. I've also been pretty loose with the term "game," conflating game systems with games. But we rarely see truly abstract simulations in games. People tend to dress up game systems with some fiction. Designers put artwork on them that is suggestive of some real-world context. Take checkers for example—abstractly, it’s a board game about entrapment and forced action, played on a diamond-shaped grid. When we say “king me”* in checkers, we’re adding a subtle bit of fiction to the game; suddenly it has acquired feudal overtones and a medieval context. Usually, the pieces have a crown embossed on them.

到目前为止，我一直在讨论正式的游戏设计——抽象的模拟。我对“游戏”一词的使用也很随意，把游戏系统和游戏混为一谈。但我们很少在游戏中看到真正抽象的模拟。人们往往会用一些虚构的东西来装扮游戏系统。设计者会在游戏中加入一些艺术元素，让人联想到现实世界中的一些场景。以跳棋为例--抽象地说，这是一种在菱形棋盘上进行的关于禁锢和强制行动的棋盘游戏。当我们在跳棋中说 "King me "*时，我们就给这个游戏添加了一点微妙的虚构成分；突然间，它就有了封建色彩和中世纪背景。通常情况下，棋子上会压印一个皇冠。

This is similar to word problems in math class. The fiction serves two purposes: it trains you to see past it to the underlying math problem, and it also trains you to recognize real-world situations where that math problem might be lurking. Games in general tend to be like word problems. You won’t find many games that are pure unclothed abstractions. * Most games have more in common with chess or checkers—they provide some level of misdirection. Usually there are metaphors for what is going on in the game.

这类似于数学课上的文字题。虚构有两个目的：一是训练你透过虚构看到潜在的数学问题，二是训练你识别现实世界中可能潜伏着数学问题的情况。一般来说，游戏往往就像文字题。你不会找到很多纯粹的抽象游戏。* 大多数游戏与国际象棋或跳棋有更多的共同之处--它们提供了某种程度的误导。游戏中通常会有一些隐喻。


While metaphors are fun to play with, players can basically ignore them. The name of the unique checker piece that has made it to the other side is irrelevant, mathematically speaking. We could call the regular pieces chickens and the crowned ones wolves and the game would not change one whit.

虽然隐喻很有趣，但玩家基本上可以忽略不计。从数学角度讲，到达另一方的唯一跳棋棋子的名称是无关紧要的。我们可以把普通棋子叫做鸡，把有冠的棋子叫做狼，而游戏却丝毫不会改变。

Games, by the very nature of what they teach, push towards this sort of understanding. Since they are about teaching underlying patterns, they train their players to ignore the fiction that wraps the patterns.

游戏，就其教学的本质而言，正是为了促进这种理解。由于游戏的目的是传授基本模式，因此游戏会训练玩家忽略包裹模式的虚构。
