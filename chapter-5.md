Until now, I've been discussing formal game design—abstract simulations. I've also been pretty loose with the term "game," conflating game systems with games. But we rarely see truly abstract simulations in games. People tend to dress up game systems with some fiction. Designers put artwork on them that is suggestive of some real-world context. Take checkers for example—abstractly, it's a board game about entrapment and forced action, played on a diamond-shaped grid. When we say ["king me"](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] in checkers, we're adding a subtle bit of fiction to the game; suddenly it has acquired feudal overtones and a medieval context. Usually, the pieces have a crown embossed on them.

截至目前，我一直在讨论正式的游戏设计——抽象的模拟。我对“游戏”一词的使用也很随意，把游戏系统和游戏混为一谈。但我们很少在游戏中看到真正抽象的模拟。人们往往会用一些虚构的东西来装扮游戏系统。设计者会在游戏中加入一些艺术元素，让人联想到现实世界中的一些场景。以跳棋为例——抽象地看，这是一种在菱形棋盘上进行的关于围捕和强制行动的棋盘游戏。当我们在跳棋中说[“升王”](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]时，我们就给这个游戏添加了一点微妙的虚构成分；突然间，它就有了封建色彩和中世纪背景。通常情况下，棋子上会刻上王冠图案。

This is similar to word problems in math class. The fiction serves two purposes: it trains you to see past it to the underlying math problem, and it also trains you to recognize real-world situations where that math problem might be lurking. 

这类似于数学课上的文字题。虚构有两个目的：一是训练你透过虚构看到潜在的数学问题，二是训练你识别现实世界中可能潜伏着数学问题的情况。

Games in general tend to be like word problems. You won't find many games that are pure unclothed [abstractions](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. Most games have more in common with chess or checkers—they provide some level of misdirection. Usually there are metaphors for what is going on in the game.

一般来说，游戏往往就像文字题。你不会找到很多纯粹的[抽象游戏](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]。大多数游戏与国际象棋或跳棋有更多的共同之处——它们提供了某种程度的误导。通常游戏中发生的事情都有一些隐喻。

While metaphors are fun to play with, players can basically ignore them. The name of the unique checker piece that has made it to the other side is irrelevant, mathematically speaking. We could call the regular pieces chickens and the crowned ones wolves and the game would not change one whit.

虽然隐喻很有趣，但玩家基本上可以忽略它们。从数学角度讲，到达另一方的独特跳棋棋子的名称是无关紧要的。我们可以把普通棋子叫做鸡，把有王冠的棋子叫做狼，而游戏却丝毫不会改变。

Games, by the very nature of what they teach, push towards this sort of understanding. Since they are about teaching underlying patterns, they train their players to ignore the fiction that wraps the patterns.

游戏根据它们所教授的内容的本质，推动了这种理解的形成。由于它们的目的是教授底层模式，所以他们训练玩家忽略包裹这些模式的虚构元素。

Back in 1976, a company called Exidy scored a first in video game history: its game [Deathrace](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] was taken off the market because of public concerns about the game's violent nature. Deathrace was loosely based on a movie called [Deathrace 2000](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. The premise involved driving a car to run over pedestrians for points.

早在 1976 年，一家名为 Exidy 的公司创造了视频游戏史上的一个第一：其游戏[《亡命赛车》](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]因公众对游戏暴力性质的担忧而被下架。《亡命赛车》是根据一部名为[《亡命赛车 2000》](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]的电影改编的。游戏的前提是驾驶汽车碾压行人以获得分数。

Mechanically, Deathrace was the same as any other game that involved catching objects moving around the screen. If you looked at this game today, with its crude pixelated graphics and its tiny iconic people, you wouldn't be particularly shocked. After all, countless other gore-fests have come along that make the game look quaint.

从机制上讲，《亡命赛车》与其他任何涉及捕捉屏幕上移动物体的游戏一样。如果你今天来看看这款游戏，看看它粗糙的像素化画面和微小的标志性人物，你不会感到特别震惊。毕竟，无数其他血腥游戏的出现让这款游戏显得古色古香。

I don't think debates about the suitability of violence in the media will disappear. Much evidence shows that [media have some effect on how we act](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]. If media didn't have an effect, we wouldn't spend so much effort on using them as teaching tools. But evidence also shows that media aren't mind-control devices (of course they aren't, or else we'd all behave like the people in the children's stories we read in elementary school).

我不认为关于媒体中暴力是否合适的争论会消失。许多证据表明，[媒体对我们的行为方式有一定的影响](#user-content-fn-10)[^10]。如果媒体没有影响，我们就不会花这么多精力把它们用作教学工具。但也有证据表明，媒体并不是精神控制设备（当然不是，否则我们的行为就会像小学时读的儿童故事里的人一样）。

Gamers, however, have always viewed this issue with some perplexity. When they defend their beloved games, they use one of the most self-defeating rallying cries in history: "It's only a game!"

然而，游戏玩家对这一问题的看法总是有些令人费解。当他们为自己心爱的游戏辩护时，他们使用的是史上最不攻自破的辩护词之一：“这只是个游戏！”

In the wake of [school shootings](#user-content-fn-11)[^11] and ex-military people decrying first-person shooters as "[murder simulators](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]," this argument doesn't carry a lot of weight. Academics who disagree with the portrayal of games as damaging to children tend to muster learned arguments about privileged spaces and magic circles. Much of the public dismisses these arguments as coming from an ivory tower.

在[校园枪击案](#user-content-fn-13)[^13]和退役军人斥责第一人称射击游戏为“[谋杀模拟器](#user-content-fn-14)[^14]”之后，这种论调并不具有多少分量。不同意将游戏描绘成对儿童有害的学者们，往往会提出关于特权空间和魔法圈的学术论据。公众大多认为这些论点来自脱离现实的学术象牙塔。

But there's a very good reason why the gamers are incredulous.

但游戏玩家感到难以置信是有充分理由的。

> 
> 这就是为什么玩家们对游戏中的道德含义不以为然——他们看不到“接上一个妓女，然后开车压过去，取回你的钱。”（这样的行为有道德上的问题）

Remember, game systems train us to see underlying mathematical patterns. The fact that I can describe Deathrace as being a game about picking up objects on a two-dimensional playing field is evidence that its "dressing" is largely irrelevant to what the game is about at its core. As you get more into a game, you'll most likely cut to the chase and examine the true underpinnings of the game, just as a music aficionado can cut past the lyrical content of different types of Latin music and determine whether a given song is a [cumbia](#user-content-fn-15)[^15] or a [marinera](#user-content-fn-16)[^16] or a salsa.

记住，游戏系统会训练我们看到潜在的数学模式。我可以把《亡命赛车》描述成一款关于在二维游戏场地上拾取物体的游戏，这就证明了它的“外衣”与游戏的核心内容基本无关。随着你对游戏的深入了解，你很可能会直奔主题，研究游戏的真正基础，就像一个音乐发烧友可以绕过不同类型拉丁音乐的抒情内容，确定某首歌曲是[康比亚舞曲](#user-content-fn-17)[^17]*、[马里内拉舞曲](#user-content-fn-18)[^18]还是萨尔萨舞曲一样。

Running over pedestrians, killing people, fighting terrorists, and eating dots while running from ghosts are all just stage settings, convenient metaphors for what a game is actually teaching. Deathrace does not teach you to run over pedestrians any more than Pac-Man teaches you to eat dots and be scared of ghosts.

碾压行人、杀害他人、与恐怖分子搏斗、以及在躲避鬼魂时吃豆子，这些都只是舞台设定，是游戏实际教授内容的便捷隐喻。《死亡赛车》教你碾压行人，并不比《吃豆人》教你吃豆子和害怕鬼魂更多。

None of this is to minimize the fact that Deathrace does involve running over pedestrians and squishing them into little tombstone icons. That's there, for sure, and it's kind of reprehensible. It's not a great setting or staging for the game, but it's also not what the game is really about.

这并不是要淡化《亡命赛车》确实涉及碾压行人并将他们压成小墓碑图标的事实。这确实是存在的，而且应该受到谴责。这不是游戏的一个很好设定或舞台，但这也并不是游戏真正要传达的内容。

Learning to see that division is important to our understanding of games, and I'll touch on it at greater length later. For now, suffice it to say that the part of games that is least understood is the formal abstract system portion of it, the mathematical part of it, the chunky part of it. Attacks on other aspects of games are likely to miss the key point—at their core, games need to develop this formal aspect of themselves in order to improve.

学会看待这种划分对于我们理解游戏非常重要，我稍后会详细论述。现在，我只想说，游戏中最不为人所理解的部分是它的形式化抽象系统部分、数学部分、认知块部分。对游戏其他方面的攻击很可能会错过关键点——游戏的核心就是需要发展其自身的形式方面，才能不断进步。

Alas, that isn't what we tend to focus on.

可惜，这并不是我们关注的重点。

The most common route these days for developing games involves grafting a story onto them. But most video game developers take a (usually mediocre) story and put little game obstacles all through it. It's as if we are requiring the player to solve a crossword puzzle in order to turn the page to get more of the novel. There is also a current of game design which unapologetically [puts story first](#user-content-fn-19)[^19]. These are often powerful emotional experiences with relatively shallow game mechanics. This isn't a flaw—it's a deliberate design choice—but it doesn't speak to the kind of learning we get from game systems.

如今，开发游戏最常见的方式就是在游戏中嫁接故事。但大多数视频游戏开发商都是在一个（通常平庸无奇的）故事中设置一些小游戏障碍。这就好像我们要求玩家解开填字游戏谜题，才能翻开一页，获得更多的小说内容。还有一股游戏设计潮流，毫不掩饰地[将故事放在首位](#user-content-fn-20)[^20]。这些游戏通常具有强大的情感体验，但游戏机制却相对肤浅。这并不是一个缺陷，而是一种刻意的设计选择，但这并不符合我们从游戏系统中获得的学习体验。

By and large, people don't play with game systems because of the stories. The stories that wrap the systems are usually side dishes for the brain. For one thing, it has been rare to see a game [story written by an actual writer](#user-content-fn-21)[^21]. As a result, they are usually around the high-school level of literary sophistication at best.

总的来说，人们玩游戏系统并不是因为故事。包装游戏系统的故事通常只是大脑的配菜。首先，[由真正的作家撰写的游戏故事](#user-content-fn-22)[^22]已经很少见了。因此，这些故事的文学水平充其量只能达到高中水平。

For another, since the games are generally about power, control, and those other primitive things, the stories tend to be as well. This means they tend to be power fantasies. That's generally considered a pretty juvenile sort of story.

另外，由于游戏一般都与权力、控制和其他原始事物有关，故事也往往如此。这意味着它们往往是权力幻想。这通常被认为是一种非常幼稚的故事。

The stories in many video games serve the same purpose as calling the über-checker a "king." It adds interesting shading to the game but the game at its core is unchanged. Often the story elements are reduced to being positive feedback to the player, to tell her that she is doing well. Remember—my background is as a writer, so this actually pisses me off. Story deserves better treatment than that.

许多电子游戏中的故事与把超级跳棋称为“国王”的目的是一样的。它为游戏增添了有趣的色彩，但游戏的核心却没有改变。故事元素往往沦为对玩家的积极反馈，告诉玩家她做得很好。请记住，我的背景是作家，所以这实际上让我很生气。故事应该得到更好的处理。

Games are not stories (though players can create stories from them). * It is interesting to make the comparison, though:

游戏不是故事（尽管玩家可以从中创造故事）。* 不过，做这样的比较还是很有意思的：

* Games tend to be experiential teaching. Stories teach vicariously.\
    游戏倾向于体验式教学。故事则是替代性教学。
    
* Games are good at objectification. Stories are good at empathy.\
    游戏擅长物化。故事善于移情。

* Games tend to quantize, reduce, and classify. Stories tend to blur, deepen,and make subtle distinctions.\
    游戏倾向于量化、缩小和分类。故事则倾向于模糊、深化和细微区分。

* Games are external—they are about people's actions. Stories (good ones,anyway) are internal—they are about people's emotions and thoughts.\
    游戏是外在的，是关于人的行为的。故事（至少好故事是这样）是内在的——它们关乎人们的情感和思想。

* Games are generators of player narratives. Stories provide a narrative.\
    游戏是玩家叙事的生成器。故事则提供了一种叙事方式。

In both cases, when stories and games are good, you can come back to them repeatedly and keep learning something new. But we never speak of fully mastering a good story.

在这两种情况下，如果故事和游戏都不错，你就可以反复回味，不断学到新东西。但我们从来没有说过要完全掌握一个好故事。

I don't think anyone would quarrel with the notion that stories are one of humanity's chief teaching tools. One might quarrel with the notion that play is the other and that mere lecturing runs a distant third. I also don't think that many would quarrel with the notion that stories have achieved far greater artistic heights than games have, despite the fact that play probably predates story (after all, even animals play, whereas stories require some form of language).

我想没有人会反对故事是人类主要教学工具之一的观点。有人可能会争论说，游戏是另一种工具，而单纯的说教只能排在第三位。我也不认为有多少人会反对故事的艺术成就远远高于游戏的观点，尽管事实上游戏可能早于故事（毕竟，连动物都会玩，而故事则需要某种形式的语言）。

Are stories superior? We often speak of wanting to make a game that makes players cry. The classic example is the text adventure game Planetfall, * where Floyd the robot sacrifices himself for you. But it happens outside of player control, so it isn't a challenge to overcome. It's grafted on, not part of the game. What does it say about games that the peak emotional moment usually cited actually involves cheating, rather than using game systems?

故事优越吗？我们经常说要做一款让玩家流泪的游戏。最经典的例子就是文字冒险游戏《行星陨落》，机器人弗洛伊德为你牺牲了自己。但这是在玩家控制之外发生的，所以并不是一个需要克服的挑战。它是嫁接上去的，不是游戏的一部分。游戏中最激动人心的时刻通常涉及作弊，而不是利用游戏系统，这说明了什么？

Games do better at emotions that relate to mastery. Stories can provide these too, however. Getting these sorts of emotional effects out of games may be the wrong approach—perhaps a better question is whether stories can be fun in the way games can.

游戏更擅长于表达与掌握技能相关的情感。故事当然也能提供这些情感。从游戏中获取这类情感效果可能是个错误的方法——也许更好的问题是，故事是否能像游戏一样有趣。

When we speak of enjoyment, we actually mean a constellation of different feelings. Having a nice dinner out can be fun. Riding a roller coaster can be fun. Trying on new clothes can be fun. Winning at table tennis can be fun. Watching your hated high school rival trip and fall in a puddle of mud can be fun. Lumping all of these under "fun" is a rather horribly vague use of the term.

当我们谈论享受时，我们实际上指的是一系列不同的感受。在外面吃一顿丰盛的晚餐可以是一种享受。坐过山车可以是一种乐趣。试穿新衣服可以是一种乐趣。赢乒乓球可以是一种乐趣。看着高中时讨厌的对手绊倒在泥潭里也是一种乐趣。把所有这些都归结为“乐趣”，这个词的用法模糊得令人发指。

Different people have classified this differently. Game designer Marc LeBlanc* has defined eight types of fun: sense-pleasure, make-believe, drama, obstacle, social framework, discovery, self-discovery and expression, and surrender. Paul Ekman, * a researcher on emotions and facial expressions, has identified literally dozens of different emotions—it’s interesting to see how many of them only exist in one language but not in others. Nicole Lazzaro did some studies watching people play games, and she arrived at four clusters of emotion represented by the facial expressions of the players: hard fun, easy fun, altered states, and the people factor.

不同的人对此有不同的分类。游戏设计师马克·勒布朗定义了八种乐趣：感官愉悦、虚构、戏剧、障碍、社会框架、发现、自我发现和表达以及投降。保罗·艾克曼是一位研究情绪和面部表情的学者，他发现了几十种不同的情绪--其中有很多情绪只存在于一种语言中，而在其他语言中却不存在，这很有意思。妮可·拉扎罗对人们玩游戏时的表情进行了研究，得出了玩家面部表情所代表的四种情绪：“玩得很开心”、“玩得很轻松”、“状态改变”和“人的因素”。

[^1]: "King me": The phrase spoken when you move a checkers piece to the last row on the board. There's an interesting political undertone to checkers, in that it is assumed that common soldiers must only charge forward, whereas kings have more freedom of movement (and may retreat)—and yet, it is also assumed that any soldier may become a king.

[^2]: "升王"：当你把跳棋棋子移动到棋盘最后一行时说的一句话。跳棋有一个有趣的政治含义，即人们认为普通士兵只能向前冲锋，而国王则有更多的行动自由（可以后退）——然而，人们也认为任何士兵都可以成为国王。

[^3]: Abstract games: In the gamer community, religious wars occur over whether or not a game should include fictional dressing or not. There is an entire genre of abstract strategy games that is arguably not enhanced by the inclusion of back story or art treatments.

[^4]: 抽象游戏：在游戏玩家群体中，关于游戏是否应包含虚构装扮的话题，常常引发激烈争论。有这样一整类抽象游戏，可以说，这类游戏并不会因为加入背景故事或者美术设计而得到改善。

[^5]: Deathrace: This was also the first instance of a movie being adapted to a game.

[^6]: Deathrace 2000: Movie released in 1975, starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. It is about cross-country racing in the future; running over pedestrians scores points in the race, and some fans are crazed enough to throw themselves under the wheels of their favorite drivers to help them win.

[^7]: 《亡命赛车》：这也是第一次将电影改编成游戏。

[^8]: 《亡命赛车 2000》：1975年上映的电影，由大卫·卡拉丁和西尔维斯特·史泰龙主演。影片讲述的是未来越野赛车的故事；碾压行人可在比赛中得分，一些车迷为了帮助自己喜欢的车手获胜，疯狂地将自己扔到车轮下。

[^9]: Effects of media on violence: An ongoing debate among academics. Most of the evidence is limited to demonstrating a rise in aggressive behavior for a few minutes—hardly advanced mind control. Others feel that vicarious exploration of violence is natural and even a necessary part of development. For a representative look at this position, try Gerard Jones's [Killing Monsters: Why Children Need Fantasy, Super Heroes, and Make-Believe Violence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465036953), published by Basic Books in 2003. In addition, the American Academy of Family Physicians determined that there was insufficient evidence to make a link between video games and violence, www.aafp.org/afp/20020401/tips/1.html. There have been [studies](http://www.international.ucla.edu/cms/files/dahl_dellaviga.pdf) showing that watching violent films may actually reduce real life violent activity.

[^10]: 媒体对暴力的影响：学术界一直在争论这个问题。大多数证据仅限于证明攻击性行为会在几分钟内增加——这还算不上高级精神控制。另一些人则认为，对暴力的代入性探索是自然的，甚至是成长的必要组成部分。要了解这种观点的代表作，请阅读杰拉德·琼斯的[《杀死怪物：为什么儿童需要幻想、超级英雄和虚构的暴力》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465036953) ，该书于 2003 年由 Basic Books 出版。此外，美国家庭医生学会认为，没有足够的证据表明电子游戏与暴力之间存在联系，www.aafp.org/afp/20020401/tips/1.html。有[研究](http://www.international.ucla.edu/cms/files/dahl_dellaviga.pdf)表明，观看暴力电影实际上可以减少现实生活中的暴力活动。

[^11]: School shootings: Several school shootings have been blamed on the effects of video games. There have also been cases of criminals claiming inspiration from acts of crime in video games. The industry's position is that games are an art form and worthy of protection under the First Amendment, and that the responsibility for keeping violent media out of the hands of children rests with parents. In addition, several statistics can be cited to buttress the opinion that video games do not have a significant effect on violent crime; for example, the incidence of violent crime has fallen dramatically just as the popularity of video games has risen. Were there a causal link, one would expect the two to rise in tandem.

[^12]: Murder simulators: The most outspoken advocate of the point of view that media and video games cause violent behavior is Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, the author of Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence, published by Crown Books in 1999. The term "murder simulators" is his.

[^13]: 校园枪击案：多起校园枪击案被归咎于电子游戏的影响。也有罪犯声称从电子游戏中的犯罪行为中获得灵感。游戏业的立场是，游戏是一种艺术形式，值得受到第一修正案的保护，而不让儿童接触暴力媒体的责任在于家长。此外，还可以引用一些统计数据来证明电子游戏对暴力犯罪没有显著影响的观点；例如，随着电子游戏的普及，暴力犯罪的发生率急剧下降。如果两者之间存在因果关系，人们就会认为两者会同步上升。

[^14]: 杀人模拟器：戴夫·格罗斯曼中校是媒体和电子游戏导致暴力行为这一观点最直率的倡导者，他是《停止教孩子杀人》一书的作者：该书由 Crown Books 于 1999 年出版。“谋杀模拟器”一词就是他提出的。

[^15]: Cumbia: A Colombian folk dance style in 4/4 with a distinctive "heartbeat" rhythm. It has become popular worldwide and is one of the commonest Latin music rhythms heard.

[^16]: Marinera: A Peruvian folk dance with a distinctive rat-a-tat beat. It is a highly dramatized courtship dance.

[^17]: 昆比亚：一种哥伦比亚民间舞蹈风格，节奏为 4/4 拍，具有独特的“心跳”节奏。它已风靡全球，是最常见的拉丁音乐节奏之一。

[^18]: 马里内拉：秘鲁民间舞蹈，具有独特的“嗒嗒”节拍。这是一种高度戏剧化的求爱舞蹈。

[^19]: Games that put story first: some of the best examples come from the genre of interactive fiction, such as Galatea by Emily Short, or Photopia by Adam Cadre.

[^20]: 把故事放在首位的游戏：一些最好的例子来自交互式小说类型，如艾米丽·肖特的《Galatea》，或亚当·卡德雷的《Photopica》。

[^21]: Story written by an actual writer: Two good books on the subject are Lee Sheldon's Character Development and Storytelling for Games (Cengage, 2004) and David Freeman's Creating Emotions in Games (New Riders, 2003). We are also seeing, as of this writing in 2013, a rise in storytelling games where narrative elements are actually treated as tokens within a game system. These games include many of the latest developments in the game genre termed "interactive fiction," as well as games such as Sleep is Death by Jason Rohrer or Daniel Benmergui's Storyteller.

[^22]: 由真正的作家撰写的故事：这方面有两本好书，一本是李·谢尔顿的《游戏角色开发与故事讲述》（Cengage，2004 年），另一本是大卫·弗里曼的《在游戏中创造情感》（New Riders，2003 年）。截至 2013 年撰写本文时，我们还看到了讲故事游戏的兴起，在这些游戏中，叙事元素实际上被视为游戏系统中的代币。这些游戏包括许多被称为“互动小说”的游戏类型的最新发展，以及杰森·罗勒的《睡眠即死亡》或丹尼尔·本默吉的《讲故事的人》等游戏。

[^23]: Players can create stories: to be precise, there are three terms that are often used interchangeably, but which can also mean very distinct things: plot, story, and narrative. A plot is a sequence of causal events created by an author: "and then they broke up because of his indiscretion." A narrative is a sequence of events from a perspective: "and then this happened." We can build a narrative out of any experience at all, and it is very common to build narratives out of gameplay, either after the game is over or even while it is still going on. A story is basically the narrative constructed out of interacting with a plot. In game design circles, we often speak of the author's story and the player's story, because these can end up diverging widely.

[^24]: 玩家可以创作故事：确切地说，有三个术语经常被互换使用，但它们也可以有非常不同的含义：情节、故事和叙事。情节是作者创作的一连串因果事件： "然后他们因为他的轻率而分手了"。叙事是从一个角度出发的一系列事件："然后就发生了这样的事"。我们可以从任何经历中构建叙事，而从游戏中构建叙事是非常常见的，可以是在游戏结束后，甚至是在游戏仍在进行时。故事基本上就是在与情节互动的过程中构建的叙事。在游戏设计圈子里，我们经常谈论作者的故事和玩家的故事，因为这两者最终可能会大相径庭。

[^25]: Planetfall: Designed by Steve Mereztky, Planetfall was a very funny text adventure game published by Infocom in 1983.
