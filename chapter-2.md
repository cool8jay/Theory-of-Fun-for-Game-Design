There are a lot of definitions of "game" out there.

关于“游戏”有很多定义。

There's a field called "game theory,"* which has something to do with games, a lot to do with psychology, even more to do with math, and not a lot to do with game design. Game theory is about how competitors make optimal choices, and it's mostly used in politics and economics, where it is frequently proven wrong.

有一个领域叫“博弈论”，它与游戏有关，与心理学有很大关系，与数学关系更大，与游戏设计关系不大。博弈论是关于竞争者如何做出最优选择的，它主要用于政治和经济领域，但经常被证明是错误的。


Looking up "game" in the dictionary isn't that helpful. Once you leave out the definitions referring to hunting, they wander all over the place. Pastimes or amusements are lumped in with contests. Interestingly, none of the definitions tend to assume that fun is a requirement: amusement or entertainment at best is required.

在字典里查找“博弈”一词并没有什么帮助。一旦撇开有关狩猎的定义，它们就会到处乱窜。消遣或娱乐与竞赛混为一谈。有趣的是，没有一个定义倾向于认为乐趣是必要条件：娱乐或消遣充其量只是必要条件。

Those few academics who have tried to define "game" have offered up everything from Roger Caillois'* "activity which is…voluntary…uncertain, unproductive, governed by rules, make-believe" to Johan Huizinga's* "free activity…outside ‘ordinary' life…" to Jesper Juul's* more contemporary and precise take: "A game is a rule-based formal system with a variable and quantifiable outcome, where different outcomes are assigned different values, the player exerts effort in order to influence the outcome, the player feels attached to the outcome, and the consequences of the activity are optional and negotiable."

"游戏是一种基于规则的正式系统，其结果是可变的、可量化的，不同的结果被赋予不同的价值，游戏者付出努力以影响结果，游戏者对结果有依恋感，活动的后果是可选的、可协商的。 "

None of these help designers find "fun," though.

但这些都无助于设计者找到“乐趣”。
