There are a lot of definitions of "game" out there.

关于“游戏”，有很多定义。

There's a field called "game theory[^1]," which has something to do with games, a lot to do with psychology, even more to do with math, and not a lot to do with game design. Game theory is about how competitors make optimal choices, and it's mostly used in politics and economics, where it is frequently proven wrong.

有一个领域叫“博弈论[^1]”，它与游戏有关，与心理学有很大关系，与数学关系更大，与游戏设计关系不大。博弈论是关于竞争者如何做出最优选择的，它主要用于政治和经济领域，但经常被证明是错误的。



[^1]: Game theory: A field of mathematics that studies decision making in formal models. Most games can be interpreted as formal models, but game theory (like economics) tends to run afoul of real-world data when the mathematical hypotheses are tested, largely because game theory is based on optimal strategies. Most people aren't optimal all the time. Game theory doesn't always help you design a better game, but it can help explain why people make certain choices in a game. 博弈论：研究形式模型中决策制定的数学领域。大多数博弈都可以被解释为形式模型，但博弈论（和经济学一样）在检验数学假设时往往会与现实世界的数据相冲突，这主要是因为博弈论是建立在最优策略的基础上的。大多数人并不是一直都是最优的。博弈论并不总能帮你设计出更好的游戏，但它可以帮助解释为什么人们会在游戏中做出某些选择。
