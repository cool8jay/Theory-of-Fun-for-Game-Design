I've spent a lot of time talking about how games intersect the human condition. I think there is an important distinction to be drawn, however. In other media, we frequently speak of how a given work is revelatory of the human condition. By this, we mean that the work is a good portrayal of the human condition—it is something that gives us insight into ourselves. As the Greeks put it, [Gnothi seauton](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]—know thyself. It's perhaps the greatest challenge we as humans face, and in many ways, it may be the greatest threat to our survival.

我已经花了很多时间来讨论游戏如何与人类的生存状态相互交织。然而，我认为有一个重要的区别需要明确。在其他媒介中，我们经常谈到某部作品如何揭示了人类的境况。我们这样说的意思是，该作品很好地描绘了人类的境况——它能让我们洞察自身。正如希腊人所说，[Gnothi seauton](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]——认识你自己。这也许是我们人类面临的最大挑战，在很多方面，它可能是对我们生存的最大威胁。

Many of the things that I have discussed in this book, such as theories of cognition, understanding of gender, learning styles, chaos theory, graph theory, and literary criticism, are fairly recent developments in human history. Humanity is engaged in a grand project of self-understanding, and most of the tools we have used in the past were imprecise at best. Over time we have developed better tools in the quest to understand ourselves better.

我在本书中讨论的许多问题，如认知理论、对性别的理解、学习风格、混沌理论、图论和文学批评等，都是人类历史上的最新发展。人类正在进行一项宏大的自我认识工程，而我们过去使用的大多数工具充其量都是不精确的。随着时间的推移，我们开发出了更好的工具，以求更好地了解我们自己。

It's an important endeavor because other humans have typically been our greatest predator. Today we have come to realize how interrelated we all are, even when the left continent doesn't know what the right continent is doing. We have come to realize that actions we undertake often have far-reaching consequences that we never anticipated. Some, such as [James Lovelock](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], have gone so far as to call us all one giant organism.

这是一项重要的工作，因为其他人类通常一直是我们最大的天敌。今天，我们逐渐认识到，即使左边的大陆不知道右边的大陆在做什么，所有人也是息息相关的。我们逐渐认识到，我们采取的行动往往会产生我们从未预料到的深远影响。有些人，比如[詹姆斯·洛夫洛克](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]，甚至称我们都是一个巨大的有机体。

I'm not being all that fanciful or idealistic in saying that we are in many ways trembling on the threshold of a far deeper understanding of ourselves than ever before, thanks to advances as diverse as medical imaging, [network theory](#user-content-fn-5)[^5], quantum physics, and even [marketing](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. Much of our view of the world is shaped by our perceptions and the way we filter information as it reaches us. Clarifying our understanding of that filter is reshaping our relationship to the world.

我并不是在胡思乱想，也不是理想主义地认为，由于医学影像、[网络理论](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]、量子物理学甚至[市场营销](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]等领域的进步，我们在很多方面都站在了比以往任何时候都更深入了解自己的门槛上。我们对世界的看法在很大程度上是由我们的感知和我们过滤信息的方式形成的。厘清我们对这种过滤方式的理解，正在重塑我们与世界的关系。

In this light, it's interesting to see how many of the most famous quotes of Jean-Paul Sartre seem eerily applicable to our relationship to the virtual worlds created by games. Students of philosophy would tell you that he was simply recognizing the artificiality of every world we perceive, since they are all mental constructs in the end.

有鉴于此，让·保罗·萨特的许多名言似乎非常适用于我们与游戏所创造的虚拟世界之间的关系，这一点非常奇妙。哲学系的学生会告诉你，他只是认识到我们所感知的每一个世界都是人为的，因为它们归根结底都是精神建构的产物。

Games thus far have not really worked to extend our understanding of ourselves. Instead, games have primarily been an arena where human behavior—often in its crudest, most primitive form—is put on display.

迄今为止，游戏并没有真正致力于扩展我们对自身的理解。相反，游戏主要是一个展示人类行为的舞台，而人类行为往往是最粗糙、最原始的形式。

There is a crucial difference between games really illuminating and exploring the human condition, and seeing how the human condition manifests while we play games. The latter is interesting in an academic sense, but it is unsurprising. The human condition manifests anywhere and anytime we interact. We may come to a better understanding of ourselves by examining our relationship to games, as this book attempts to do, but for games to truly step up to the plate, they need to provide us with insights into ourselves.

游戏真正揭示和探索人类的状况，与我们在玩游戏时看到人类的状况是如何表现出来的，这两者之间有着至关重要的区别。后者在学术意义上是有趣的，但也不足为奇。人类状况在我们互动的任何地方和任何时候都会表现出来。通过研究我们与游戏的关系，我们可能会更好地了解自己，本书也试图这样做，但游戏要真正发挥其作用，它们需要为我们提供对自己深入的见解。

[^6]: Marketing: Yes, even marketing has given us insights into the way humanity works. In particular, marketing has taught us much about mob behavior, information propagation through groups, and the tactics of persuasion.

[^7]: 网络理论：围绕图论的一个子集，研究网络的整个科学分支已经兴起。如要深入了解，我推荐邓肯·沃茨的《小世界》（普林斯顿大学出版社，1999 年）和阿尔伯特·拉斯洛·巴拉巴西的《链接》（Plume，2003 年）。

[^8]: 市场营销：是的，即使是市场营销也能让我们洞察人类的运作方式。特别是，市场营销教会了我们很多关于群体行为、群体信息传播和说服策略的知识。
