I've spent a lot of time talking about how games intersect the human condition. I think there is an important distinction to be drawn, however. In other media, we frequently speak of how a given work is revelatory of the human condition. By this, we mean that the work is a good portrayal of the human condition—it is something that gives us insight into ourselves. As the Greeks put it, [Gnothi seauton](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]—know thyself. It's perhaps the greatest challenge we as humans face, and in many ways, it may be the greatest threat to our survival.

我已经花了很多时间来讨论游戏如何与人类的生存状态相互交织。然而，我认为有一个重要的区别需要明确。在其他媒介中，我们经常谈到某部作品如何揭示了人类的境况。我们这样说的意思是，该作品很好地描绘了人类的境况——它能让我们洞察自身。正如希腊人所说，[Gnothi seauton](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]——认识你自己。这也许是我们人类面临的最大挑战，在很多方面，它可能是对我们生存的最大威胁。

Many of the things that I have discussed in this book, such as theories of cognition, understanding of gender, learning styles, chaos theory, graph theory, and literary criticism, are fairly recent developments in human history. Humanity is engaged in a grand project of self-understanding, and most of the tools we have used in the past were imprecise at best. Over time we have developed better tools in the quest to understand ourselves better.

我在本书中讨论的许多问题，如认知理论、对性别的理解、学习风格、混沌理论、图论和文学批评等，都是人类历史上的最新发展。人类正在进行一项宏大的自我认识工程，而我们过去使用的大多数工具充其量都是不精确的。随着时间的推移，我们开发出了更好的工具，以求更好地了解我们自己。

It's an important endeavor because other humans have typically been our greatest predator. Today we have come to realize how interrelated we all are, even when the left continent doesn't know what the right continent is doing. We have come to realize that actions we undertake often have far-reaching consequences that we never anticipated. Some, such as [James Lovelock](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], have gone so far as to call us all one giant organism.

这是一项重要的工作，因为其他人类通常一直是我们最大的天敌。今天，我们逐渐认识到，即使左边的大陆不知道右边的大陆在做什么，所有人也是息息相关的。我们逐渐认识到，我们采取的行动往往会产生我们从未预料到的深远影响。有些人，比如[詹姆斯·洛夫洛克](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]，甚至称我们都是一个巨大的有机体。
