Game design is becoming a discipline. In the past 10 years there has been a large increase in the number of books about game design, the beginnings of a critical vocabulary, and the creation of academic programs. The field has started to move away from the hit-or-miss shot-in-the-dark approach, and towards an understanding of how games work.

游戏设计正在成为一门学科。在过去的 10 年中，有关游戏设计的书籍数量大幅增加，批判性词汇开始出现，学术项目也开始设立。这一领域已经开始摆脱随机尝试、盲目射击的方法，转而了解游戏是如何运作的。

On the facing pages, I've filled out a few grids with different human endeavors. This may rub you wrong philosophically. Bear with me—there are two sorts of people in this world, those who divide everyone into two sorts of people and those who don't.

在对面的页面上，我用不同的人类活动填写了一些格子。这可能会让你在哲学上产生误解。请耐心听我说——这个世界上有两种人，一种人把每个人都分成两种人的人，另一种则不是。

Any given activity can be performed either by yourself or with others. If you are doing it with others, you can be working either with or against each other. I call these three approaches collaborative, competitive, and solo.

任何一项活动都可以自己进行，也可以与他人一起进行。如果是与他人一起进行，你们可以相互合作，也可以相互对抗。我把这三种方式称为合作式、竞争式和单干式。

Down the side of our grid, I've made a subtler distinction. Are you a passive consumer of this activity (to the degree the activity permits)? An audience member? If you are someone who doesn't work on the activity, but instead lets the work of others wash over you, we'll call you interested in the experiential side of the activity—you want the experience.

在网格的下方，我做了更细微的区分。你是这项活动的被动消费者（在活动允许的范围内）？还是观众？如果你不参与活动，而是任由他人的工作影响你，我们就称你对活动的体验方面感兴趣——你想要这种体验。

Are you actually creating the experience? Then you are engaging in a constructive activity. Maybe instead, you are taking the experience apart, to see how it works. I used to label this destructive, but it's not really; often the original is left behind, intact though somewhat bruised and battered. So perhaps deconstructive is a better term.

你真的在创造体验吗？那你就是在从事建设性的活动。也许相反，你是在拆解体验，看看它是如何运作的。我曾经给这种做法贴上破坏性的标签，但其实并非如此；通常情况下，原来的东西会被留下来，虽然有些伤痕累累，但却完好无损。因此，“解构”也许是一个更好的说法。

My second grid shows how we can analyze music. When I look at the chart for music, what I see is a constellation of music-based entertainment. If I made a similar chart for books, it would cover prose-based entertainment. Basically, this chart can be applied to any medium.

第二个网格展示了我们如何分析音乐。当我查看音乐图表时，我看到的是一群基于音乐的娱乐活动。如果我为书籍制作一个类似的图表，它将涵盖散文类娱乐。基本上，这个图表可以适用于任何媒介。

"Game" is a very fuzzy word. A few times in this book I have mentioned game systems as being distinct from games, or as the core element that makes something a game (in some senses). But "game systems" are not a medium. They are, depending on the definition, one use of a medium. The medium is really an unwieldy phrase like “formal abstract models for teaching patterns." I have taken to calling these "[ludic artifacts(#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" to distinguish them from the fuzziness of "game." Even though ludic artifacts—like fire drills or CIA model war games of the future of the Middle East—may not necessarily be fun, they still belong on the chart. The fact that they are not fun has more to do with their implementation than with their intrinsic nature.

“游戏”是一个非常模糊的词。在本书中，我曾多次提到游戏系统有别于游戏，或者游戏系统是游戏的核心要素（在某些意义上）。但 “游戏系统”并不是一种媒介。根据不同的定义，它们只是媒介的一种用途。媒介实际上是一个难以理解的短语，比如“教学模式的正式抽象模型”。我习惯于称这些为“[可笑的人工制品](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]”，以区别于“游戏”的模糊性。尽管可笑的人工制品——如消防演习或中情局关于中东未来的战争游戏模型——不一定有趣，但它们仍然属于图表。它们之所以不好玩，与其说与它们的内在本质有关，不如说与它们的实施方式有关。

Interaction happens with all media (at a minimum, we interact by engaging with the work). Actively and constructively interacting with stage-based media is termed "acting" and interacting with prose-based media is termed "writing." There's been a lot of discussion in professional video game design circles about "the surrender of authorship" inherent in adding greater flexibility to games and in the ["mod" community](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. I think the key insight here is that players are simply "interacting with the medium" in a way that isn't purely experiential.

互动发生在所有媒体上（至少，我们通过与作品互动）。与舞台媒体进行积极和建设性的互动被称为“表演”，与散文媒体进行互动被称为“写作”。在专业的电子游戏设计圈子里，有很多关于在游戏和[“模组”社区](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]中增加更多灵活性所固有的“放弃作者身份”的讨论。我认为，关键在于玩家只是以一种非纯粹体验的方式“与媒介互动”。

In other words, modding is just playing the game in another way, sort of like a budding writer might rework plots of characters from other writers into derivative journeyman fiction or into fan fiction. The fact that some forms of interaction are constructive (modding a game), experiential (playing a game), or deconstructive (hacking a game) is immaterial; the same activities are possible with a given play, book, or song. Arguably, the act of literary analysis is much the same as the act of hacking a game—the act of disassembling the components of a given piece of work in a medium to see how it works, or even to get it to do things, carry messages, or otherwise represent itself as something other than what the author of the piece intended.

换句话说，MOD 只是以另一种方式玩游戏，就像新晋作家可能会把其他作家笔下的人物情节改编成衍生的穿越小说或粉丝小说。事实上，某些互动形式是建设性的（修改游戏）、体验性的（玩游戏）或解构性的（黑客攻击游戏）并不重要；同样的活动在特定的戏剧、书籍或歌曲中也是可能的。可以说，文学分析的行为与黑客攻击游戏的行为如出一辙——拆解特定作品在某种媒介中的组成部分，看看它是如何运作的，甚至让它做事、传递信息，或以其他方式表现出与作品作者意图不同的东西。

Some of the activities on the first chart aren't what you would normally term "fun," even though they are almost all activities in which you learn patterns. We can sit here and debate whether performing music, writing a story, or drawing a picture is fun. Having training in all three, I can tell you that they are all hard work, which isn't something we necessarily consider fun. But I derive great fulfillment from these activities. This is perhaps analogous to watching Hamlet on stage, reading [Lord Jim](#user-content-fn-5)[^5], * or viewing [Guernica](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]—an interaction with a system rich and challenging enough to permit me to treat it as a learning opportunity.

第一张图表中的一些活动并不是你通常所说的“有趣”，尽管它们几乎都是学习模式的活动。我们可以坐在这里争论表演音乐、写故事或画画是否有趣。我在这三方面都接受过训练，我可以告诉你，它们都是艰苦的工作，我们不一定会认为这很有趣。但我从这些活动中获得了极大的成就感。这也许类似于在舞台上观看《哈姆雷特》、阅读[《吉姆勋爵》](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]或观赏[《格尔尼卡》](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]——与一个系统的互动丰富而富有挑战性，足以让我把它当作一次学习的机会。

The chills that go down your back are not always indicative of something that you find enjoyable. A tragedy or moment of great sorrow can cause them. The moment you recognize a pattern, your body will give you the chill as a sign. Just as writing isn't necessarily fun but might be something valuable for the writer to do, or practicing piano for hours on end might not be fun but something that gives fulfillment, engaging in interaction with games need not be fun, either, but might indeed be fulfilling, thought-provoking, challenging, and also difficult, painful, and even compulsive.

背脊发凉并不总是你觉得愉快的事情。悲剧或极度悲伤的时刻也会引起它们。当你发现一个规律的时候，你的身体就会给你寒意作为信号。就像写作并不一定有趣，但对写作者来说可能是有价值的事情，或者连续几个小时的钢琴练习可能并不有趣，但却能给人带来成就感一样，参与游戏互动也不一定有趣，但确实可能是充实的、发人深省的、具有挑战性的，也可能是困难的、痛苦的，甚至是强迫性的。

In other words, games can take forms we don't recognize. They might not be limited to being "a game" or even a "[software toy](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]." The definition of "game" implies certain things, as do the words "toy," "sport," and "hobby." The layman's definition of "game" covers only some of the boxes in the grid. Arguably, all of the boxes in the grid are fun to someone. We need to start thinking of games a little more broadly. Otherwise, we will be missing out on large chunks of their potential as a medium.

换句话说，游戏可以有我们不认识的形式。它们可能并不局限于“游戏”，甚至是“[软件玩具](#user-content-fn-10)[^10]”。与“玩具”、“运动”和“爱好”等词一样，“游戏”的定义也暗示着某些东西。外行人对 “游戏”的定义只包括网格中的部分方框。可以说，网格中的所有方格对某些人来说都是有趣的。我们需要从更广阔的角度来看待游戏。否则，我们就会错过游戏作为一种媒介所具有的巨大潜力。

The reason why the rise of critique and academia surrounding games is important is that it finally adds the missing element to put games in context with the rest of human endeavor. It signals their arrival as a medium. Considering how long they have been around, they're a little late to the party.

围绕游戏的评论和学术研究的兴起之所以重要，是因为它最终增加了一个缺失的元素，将游戏与人类其他活动联系起来。它标志着游戏作为一种媒介的到来。考虑到游戏已经存在了很长时间，它们的出现有点晚了。

Once games are seen as a medium, we can start worrying about whether they are a medium that permits art. All other media do, after all.

一旦游戏被视为一种媒介，我们就可以开始担心它是否是一种允许艺术存在的媒介。毕竟，所有其他媒体都是如此。

Pinning art down is tricky. We can start from the basics, though. What is art for? Communicating. That's intrinsic to the definition. And (if you've bought into the premises of this book) we have seen that the basic intent of games is rather communicative as well—it is the creation of a symbolic logic set that conveys meaning.

把艺术固定下来是件棘手的事。不过，我们可以从最基本的开始。艺术是用来做什么的？传播。这是艺术的固有定义。而且（如果你相信本书的前提），我们已经看到，游戏的基本意图也相当具有交流性，它是创造一种传递意义的符号逻辑集。

Some apologists for games like to tout the fact that games are interactive as a sign that they are special. Others like to say that interactivity is precisely why games cannot be art, because art relies on authorial intent and control. Both positions are balderdash. [Every medium is interactive](#user-content-fn-11)[^11]—just go look on the grid.

一些为游戏辩护的人喜欢把游戏具有互动性这一事实作为游戏特别的标志。还有人喜欢说，互动性正是游戏不能成为艺术的原因，因为艺术依赖于作者的意图和控制。这两种观点都是胡说八道。[每一种媒介都是互动的](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]——去网格上看看就知道了。

So what is art? My take on it is simple. Media provide information. Entertainment provides comforting, simplistic information. And art provides challenging information, stuff that you have to think about in order to absorb. Art uses a particular medium to communicate within the constraints of that medium, and often what is communicated is thoughts about the medium itself (in other words, a formalist approach to arts—much modern art falls in this category).

那么什么是艺术呢？我的看法很简单。媒体提供信息。娱乐提供的是令人欣慰的、简单化的信息。而艺术提供的是具有挑战性的信息，是你必须思考才能吸收的东西。艺术使用一种特定的媒介，在该媒介的限制下进行交流，交流的内容往往是对媒介本身的思考（换句话说，艺术的形式主义方法——很多现代艺术都属于这一类）。

The medium shapes the nature of the message, of course, but the message can be representational, impressionistic, narrative, emotional, intellectual, or whatever else. Some art works are solo creations, and some are collaborative (and they can all be made collaborative to an extent, I believe). And some media are actually the result of the collaboration of specialists in many different media, working together to present a work that is incomplete without the use of multiple media within it. Film is one such medium. And games are another.

当然，媒介决定了信息的性质，但信息可以是表现性的、印象性的、叙事性的、情感性的、知识性的，或其他任何形式的。有些艺术作品是单独创作的，有些则是合作创作的（我相信它们在某种程度上都可以是合作创作的）。而有些媒体实际上是许多不同媒体的专家合作的结果，他们共同完成的作品，如果没有多种媒体的使用，是不完整的。电影就是这样一种媒体。游戏是另一种。

One of the most common points I hear about why video games are not an art form is that they are just for fun. They are just entertainment. Hopefully, I've made it clear why that is a dangerous underestimation of fun. But most music is also just entertainment, and most novels are read just for fun, and most movies are mere escapism, and yes, even most pretty pictures are just pretty pictures. The fact that most games are merely entertainment does not mean that this is all they are doomed to be.

关于电子游戏为什么不是一种艺术形式，我最常听到的观点之一就是它们只是为了好玩。它们只是娱乐而已。希望我已经说得很清楚，这是对娱乐的危险低估。但是，大多数音乐也只是娱乐，大多数小说也只是为了消遣，大多数电影也只是逃避现实，是的，甚至大多数漂亮的图片也只是漂亮的图片。大多数游戏只是娱乐，但这并不意味着它们注定只能是娱乐。

Mere entertainment becomes art when the communicative element in the work is either novel or exceptionally well done. It really is that simple. The work has the power to alter how people perceive the world around them. And it's hard to imagine a medium more powerful in that regard than video games, where you are presented with a virtual world that reacts to your choices.

当作品中的交流元素新颖或做得特别好时，单纯的娱乐就变成了艺术。就是这么简单。作品有能力改变人们对周围世界的看法。在这方面，很难想象有哪种媒体比电子游戏更有力量，因为在电子游戏中，你所看到的虚拟世界会对你的选择做出反应。

"Well done" and "novel" mean, basically, craft. You can have well-crafted entertainment that fails to reach the level of art. The upper reaches of art are usually subtler achievements. They are works that you can return to again and again, and still learn something new from. The analogy for a game would be one you can replay over and over again, and still discover new things.

“做得好”和“新颖”基本上是指工艺。精心制作的娱乐作品可能达不到艺术的水平。艺术的上层通常是更微妙的成就。这些作品可以让你反复回味，并从中汲取新的东西。对于游戏的类比是，一个可以反复玩游戏，但仍能从中发现新的东西。

Since games are closed formal systems, that might mean that games can never be art in that sense. But I don't think so. I think that means that we just need to decide what we want to say with a given game—something big, something complex, something open to interpretation, something where there is no single right answer—and then make sure that when the player interacts with it, she can come to it again and reveal whole new aspects to the challenge presented.

由于游戏是封闭的形式系统，这可能意味着游戏在这个意义上永远不可能成为艺术。但我不这么认为。我认为，这意味着我们只需要确定我们想用某款游戏表达什么——大型的、复杂的、可解释的、没有唯一正确答案的——然后确保当玩家与之互动时，她可以再次进入游戏，并揭示所面临挑战的全新方面。

[^1]: Ludic artifact: It's an awkward term, but it avoids the challenges inherent in using "game" for very fuzzy concepts. In short:
• The world is full of systems.
• If we approach these with Suits' lusory attitude, we learn how they work through play, as elucidated in this book.
• Fun is the feedback the brain gives us in the process.
• We generally term the resultant activity a game.
• Systems generally need to meet certain qualifications to be a good opportunity for the above. We could call these ludic structures.
• A consciously designed ludic structure is a ludic artifact.
• Even ones that are not consciously designed tend to have such as design imposed on them by our act of turning them into a game: we layer on goals, success metrics, etc.

	* 这个世界充满了系统。
	* 如果我们以苏伊茨的“游戏”态度来对待这些系统，我们就能通过游戏来了解它们是如何运作的。正如本书所阐明的那样。
	* 乐趣是大脑在这一过程中给予我们的反馈。
	* 我们通常将由此产生的活动称为游戏。
	* 一般来说，系统需要满足一定的条件才能成为实现上述目标的好机会。我们可以把这些系统称为“游戏结构”。

[^3]: Mod or modding: Many video games are constructed in a way that permits players to create variants on the rules, alter the artwork, or even create whole new games using the game's software. This has led to large "mod communities" of player-contributed games and content. This is similar to "house rules" for board games.

[^4]: 模组或修模：许多电子游戏的构造方式允许玩家对游戏规则进行修改，改变游戏美术设计，甚至使用游戏软件创建全新的游戏。这就形成了由玩家贡献游戏和内容的大型“模组社区”。这与棋盘游戏的“内部规则”类似。

[^12]: 每一种媒介都是互动的：无论你偏好马歇尔·麦克卢汉的“热”和“冷”媒体命名法，还是更现代的受众参与艺术建构的概念，如读者反应理论，这些都有点学术性，因为这只是关于图表中一个方框的互动程度的争论。
