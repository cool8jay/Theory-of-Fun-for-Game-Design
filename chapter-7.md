Learning can be problematic. For one thing, it's kind of hard work. Our brains may unconsciously direct us to learn, but if we're pushed by parents, teachers, or even our own logical brains, we often resist most mightily.

学习是个问题。首先，学习是一项艰苦的工作。我们的大脑可能会无意识地引导我们学习，但如果父母、老师，甚至我们自己的逻辑思维催促我们，我们往往会极力反抗。

When I was a kid taking math classes, teachers always made us write out proofs. Many of the students were good enough at algebra that they could look at a given problem and see the answer and then write it down, but it didn't matter—the teacher made them actually work it out:

我小时候上数学课时，老师总是让我们写出证明。很多学生代数学得很好，他们可以看着一道题，看到答案，然后写下来，但这并不重要——老师让他们真正地去解决它：老师让他们真正算出来：

x<sup>2</sup> + 5 = 30

We weren't allowed to just write x = 5. We had to write out:

∴ x<sup>2</sup> = 30 – 5

∴ x<sup>2</sup> = 25

∴ x = √25

∴ x = 5

We always thought this was stupid. If we could just look at the problem and see that x = 5, why the hell couldn't we just write it down? Why go through the pesky process? All it did was slow us down!

我们一直认为这很愚蠢。如果我们一看问题就知道 x = 5，为什么不能直接写下来呢？为什么要经历这个讨厌的过程？这只会拖慢我们的速度！

Of course, the good reason is that multiplying -5 by -5 is also 25, and thus there are actually two answers. Skipping to the end, we're more likely to forget that.

当然，好的理由是 -5 乘以 -5 也是 25，因此实际上有两个答案。跳到最后，我们更容易忘记这一点。

That doesn't stop the human mind from wanting to take shortcuts, however.

不过，这并不妨碍人类的大脑想走捷径。

Once players look at a game and ascertain the pattern and the ultimate goal, they'll try to find the optimal path to getting there. And one of the classic problems with games of all sorts is that players often have little compunction about violating the theoretical "magic circle" that encompasses games and makes them protected spaces in which to practice.

一旦玩家看懂了一个游戏，并确定了游戏的模式和最终目标，他们就会努力寻找达到目标的最佳路径。而各种游戏的一个典型问题是，玩家往往会毫不犹豫地违反理论上的“魔法圈”，因为这个魔法圈涵盖了游戏，并使游戏成为受保护的练习空间。

In other words, many players are willing to cheat.

换句话说，许多玩家愿意作弊。

This is a natural impulse. It's not a sign of people being bad (though we can call it bad sportsmanship). It's actually a sign of lateral thinking, which is a very important and valuable mental skill to learn. When someone cheats at a game, they may be acting unethically, but they're also exercising a skill that makes them more likely to survive. It's often called "cunning."

这是一种自然的冲动。这并不是人们变坏的表现（尽管我们可以称之为不良体育道德）。这实际上是横向思维的一种表现，而横向思维是一种非常重要且值得学习的心智技能。当有人在游戏中作弊时，他们的行为可能是不道德的，但他们同时也在锻炼一种技能，使他们更有可能生存下去。这通常被称为“狡猾”。

"Cheating" is a long-standing tradition in warfare. The first recorded "[rules of proper warfare](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" date back to the sixth century BCE! And once conventions are followed, violating them is a powerful tactic. "Let's throw sand in our opponent's eyes." "Let's attack by night." "Let's not charge out of the woods and ambush them instead." "Let's make them walk through the mud so we can shoot them full of arrows." As one of the most important strategic adages has it, "If you cannot choose the battle, at least choose the battlefield."

在战争中，“作弊”是一个由来已久的传统。最早有记载的“[正确的战争规则](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]”可以追溯到公元前六世纪！而一旦约定俗成，违反规则就是一种强大的战术。“往对手眼睛里扔沙子。”“让我们夜袭。”“我们不要从树林里冲出来，而是埋伏起来。”“让他们在泥泞中穿行，让他们身中数箭。”正如最重要的战略格言之一所说：“如果不能选择战斗，至少要选择战场。”

When a player cheats in a game, she is choosing a battlefield that is broader in context than the game itself.

当玩家在游戏中作弊时，她所选择的战场要比游戏本身的范围更广。

Cheating is a sign that the player is in fact grokking the game. From a strict survival point of view, cheating is a winning strategy. Duelists who shoot first while their opponent is still pacing off are far more likely to reproduce. (Of course, above the game of dueling lies the game of social standing. Cheating in the subgame can result in a major mistake in the metagame!)

作弊是玩家真正理解游戏的标志。从严格的生存角度来看，作弊是一种制胜策略。在对手还在踱步的时候先开枪的决斗者更有可能继续生存繁衍。(当然，决斗游戏之上还有社会地位游戏。在次级博弈中作弊可能会导致在元博弈中犯下大错！）。

译者注：戈尔迪安问题源自古希腊故事中的一个著名难题。据传说，弗里吉亚的国王戈尔迪奥斯有一个非常复杂的绳结，被称为戈尔迪安结。神谕宣称，能够解开这个结的人将会成为亚细亚之王。很多人试图解开它，但都失败了。

最终，亚历山大大帝在无法解开结的情况下，用剑将其切开，象征性地解决了这个问题，从而展示了他的决断力和领导力。这个故事后来被用来比喻那些看似复杂难以解决，但通过大胆而直接的方法可以轻易解决的问题。
